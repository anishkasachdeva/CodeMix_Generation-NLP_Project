I'm not always a big Joss Whedon fan, but he did a good job with the humor to spice up the team origin story. Were you surprised that it worked with so many characters?	main hamesha ek bada  Joss Whedon prashansak nahin hoon, lekin unhonne teem kee mool kahaanee ko masaala dene ke lie haasy ke saath achchha kaam kiya. kya aap aashcharyachakit the ki isane kaee paatron ke saath kaam kiya?

No, he is right	nahin, vah sahee hai

Hi there. What did you think of the movie?	namaste. aapane philm ke baare mein kya socha?
Hello?	namaste?
Hi, I think it's great, it would be good as a B roadway musical	namaste, mujhe lagata hai ki yah bahut achchha hai, yah bee rodave sangeet ke roop mein achchha hoga
Why do you think it would be great as a Broadway musical?	aapako kya lagata hai ki brodave sangeet ke roop mein yah bahut achchha hoga?
mainly the singing but also since the story is about a journey.	mukhy roop se gaayan lekin jab se kahaanee ek yaatra ke baare mein hai.
What do you think?	tum kya sochate ho?
The music in movie is very catchy and enjoyable, so I agree.	philm mein sangeet bahut hee aakarshak aur aanandadaayak hai, isalie main sahamat hoon.
Whose journey did you find most compelling?	aapane kisakee yaatra ko sabase adhik sammohak paaya?
Anna's journey	anna kee yaatra
Did you think the conclusion was satisfying for her character?	kya aapako lagata hai ki nishkarsh usake charitr ke lie santoshajanak tha?

I agree	main sahamat hoon
Have you heard of the fairy tale that the movie was based on?	kya aapane paree katha ke baare mein suna hai jo philm par aadhaarit thee?
No, never.	nahin kabhee nahin.

Hey! Have you ever seen The Social Network?	hey! kya The social network dekha?
I have not, but I know it was filmed in 2010.	nahi yar. lekin muje patha hein ki voh 2010 mien filmed huva
Have you seen it?	aap dekha?
I personally enjoyed it. It tells the story of the founding of Facebook. Do you like movies based on reality?	mein personally enjoy kiya.. facebook ka story hein yar.. reality based movie dekhna pasand hein?
I do. I also like Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake. The movie got good reviews, so maybe I will watch it.	muje bhi.. muje jesse eisenberg aur justin timberlake pasand hein. yeh movie ache reviews nikli, maybe mein watch jarur karunga
I really would recommend it myself. It was extremely good. Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerburg in such an intense way. It's a great film.	tho mein jarur recommend karunga.. yeh ache hein.. kya jesse eisenberg yaani zuckerburg ka role play intense se kiya.. voh tho badiya film hein
Did you read the book the movie was based on? The Accidental Billionaires?	kya aap us book ko read kiya jo yeh movie? the accidental billionaires?
I just learned it was based on the book today. I'm definitely going to have to read it. 	mein kuch learn kiya hein us book se aaj.. mein definitely padunga
Apparently, the biographical part of the movie isn't exactly true to life, since the movie was based on the book. Mark Zuckerberg had no part in contributing to the movie.	acha tho biographical part tho is movie mein jarur sach kaha hoga.. kyon ki is movie tho book ka based hein.. mark zuckerberg tho koi contribute nahi deya hoga
That is certainly interesting to know. I always wondered about it myself. Apparently, Saverin was the only consultant with any true to life information.	Ye janna jarur interesting hai. Main hamesha is bare me sochta tha. Apparently, Saverin akela consultant tha jiske paas koi true to life information thi.
Was it weird to see Armie Hammer play two people?	Kya Armie Hammer ko do log play karte hue dekhna weird tha?
It was! To be honest with you they did such a good job that I had a hard time realizing they were both Armie Hammer. He is an amazing actor. I also think Facesmash is a hilarious startup name.	Wo tha! To be honest unhone itna accha kaam kiya ke mujhe realize nahi hua dono Armie Hammer the. Wo ek amazing actor hai. Main ye bhi sochta hu k Facesmash ek hilarious startup name hai
It is! and what a crazy story... basically he got dumped and made millions off of trying to get even with her.	Ye hai! Kya crazy story hai ..basically wo dumped hogaya aur usse badle lete huye millions kama liye
How contentious of a person. Based off what you know of him would you have be friendly with him if you were in school with him at the time?	Kinda contentious banda hai. Jitna tum abhi jaante ho, agar uske saath school me hote to kya uske sath friendly hote?
Hmm... probably not. He doesn't seem to have good luck keeping friends. How ironic as he invented Facebook. Do you think you'd have been friends?	Hmm.. shayad nahi. Dost rakhne me to uska koi accha luck nahi hai. Kitna ironic hai k usne Facebook invent kiya. Tum kya sochte ho, kya uske dost hote?
Absolutely not 1	Bilkul nahi.
I thought it was ironic as well. I couldnt believe it. 	Maine bhi socha tha k ye ironic hai. Mujhe to believe nahi hua
The scene where Christy Lee says Facebook me is kinda funny, too. It certainly beats facesmash me.	Wo scene jaha Christy Lee bolti hai Facebook me funny type ka hai. Certainly facesmash me bolne se to accha hai.
Agreed. It makes sense, but I had no idea how much help Zuckerberg had along the way... Especially from one of the founders of Napster!	Agreed. Iska sense to banta hai but mujhe koi idea nahi tha ki Zuckerberg ko raaste me kitni help mili hai, especially Napster k ek founder se.
Justin Timberlake plays him so well too. I never knew about it either, but keep in mind it's based off the book. Who knows how much he actually was involved.	Justin Timberlake ne use bahut acha play kiya hai. Mujhe bhi is baare me kuch nahi pata tha, lekin ye dhyan me rakho k ye book pe based hai. Kise pata wo actually kitna involved tha.
That is true. I wonder if Mark Zuckerberg actually invited Sean Parker to live at Facebook headquarters!	Ye to sahi hai. Main is soch me hu ki kya Mark Zuckerberg ne Sean Parker ko actually Facebook ke headquarters me rehne k liye bulaya tha!
I love how he was doing it from a house. You know that much happened. If Sean Parker was there, who knows. I love how tech company start ups are out of houses. I wonder what the other continent was they were trying to expand to first.	Unka ye sab ghar se karna mujhe pasand aaya. Tumhe pata hai kitna kuch hua. Agar Sean Parker waha rahta to, kise pata. I love kaise ye tech company start up ghar se chal rahi hai. I wonder wo kaunse dusre continent me pahle expand karna chahte the
I think that it is pretty funny considering the success he gained... and "Thefacebook"? First Facesmash, then Harvard Connection then Thefacebook... yikes!	I think  uski success ko consider  karte hue Thefacebook kafi funny hai. Pahle Facesmash, phir Harvard Connection phir TheFacebook yikes!
Thefacebook is just rotten. It seems like Zuckerberg really shafted everyone else in the situation.	Thefacebook to bilkul bekaar hai. Aisa lagta hai Zuckerberg ne sahi me dusre logo ki leli
It's kind of creepy how he just waited for Albright to accept the friend request, too.	Uska Albright ka friend request accept karne tak wait karna kaafi creepy tha
It's really sort of sad to me. He hasn't really changed from the beginning of the story.	Mujhe to ye sad laga. Wo story ki beginning se jyada badla nahi.
That's how I feel. I'm not surprised he had to do a settlement.	Mujhe to aisa lagta hai. Main surprise nahi hu ke use settlement karna pada
He founded the biggest social network the world has ever seen, but he seems like a person who people hate.	Usne duniya ka sabse bada social network banaya but wo ek aisa aadmi lagta hai jise log hate karte hai
Extremely misanthropic. I would agree. It's overall kind of sad.	Bilkul misanthropic. Main to agree karta hu. Overall ye sad hai.
At least he didn't use his intelligence for true evil.	USNE  BURAEE KARNE KE LIYE DIMAAK KA UPAYOG NAHI KIYA

Hello! Do you like superhero movies?	Namaste! aap ko superhero movies aaccha lagega kya?
yes. batman begins! I think this a great batman film. have you seen it?	ha. batman start huwa! mene socha hi ki ee batman film tho great hi. aap dekha hi kya?
Yes, I have. Christian Bale is my favorite Batman so far.	ha. mere pas hi. Christian Bale tho mera favorite Batman hi abhi tak.
Do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them?	aap movies ka ratings dekega kya , dekhne ke pehle ?
I usually do. but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not	mene dekungi. lekin rating se kuch farak nahi padega , jho mene dekungi ya nahi.
The film has several great big name actors, which is another reason I like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone	ee film tho bahut great bada actors tha, ee tho dusara reason hi mere kho aacha laga aur mene dekungi bina actors keliye.
I agree, there are quite a few great actors in Batman Begins. I like Liam Neeson too, even though he is one of the villains.	ha, bahut sara great actors hi Batman Begins me. mene like karungi Liam Neeson tho bi, vo tho eek villain be hi.
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest. along with super heros and villans.  a good  rating does help me feel like I will not waste my time watching something awful	utna potential hi actors me dekhke big screen mere kho bahut interest aaya tha. milke dono super heros aur villans bhi hi. isko aacha rating help karega , mene time waste mat karungi dusara awful movie dekhke.
but the same time will not deter me from a film If i am just into the genre	lekin same time me mene nahi deter karungi ee film se if mene just genre dekhke.
I personally prefer good ratings. Even if a movie has many good actors, if it's rated poorly, I usually won't watch it in theaters.	Main personally acchi ratings prefer karta hun .Even agar kisi movie mein kayi acche actors hain lekin agar uski rating kharab hai to main usko usually theaters mein nahi dekhta.
I'm not sure if I agree with the Metacritic Score of 70/100, though.	Waise mein sure nahi hun ki mein Metacritic  ke 70/100 score se agree karunga.
The 84% on Rotten Tomatoes seems more accurate.	Rotten Tomatoes pe 84%  zyada accurate lagta hai.
I will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on DVD/Video if the rating turn me off.	Generally mere paas enough patience hota hai to wait for a film to be released on DVD/Video agar mujhe rating pasand nahi aati.
What did you think of the bat scene in the movie?	Movie ke bat scene ke baare mein kya khyal hai ?
I felt that scene shows the story of this film well, and is thought out.	Main sochta hun ki ye scene shows the story of this film well, kaafi socha samjha hai.
I wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well, though.	Waise I wonder ki bats ke liye dry well se behtar koi place ho sakti thi kya
batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out	batman as a child accha step tha by the filmmaker ye dikhane ke liye ki uski life kaise start hui
Because this movie is called Batman Begins, I agree that it was appropriate to show Bruce's beginnings.	Because movie ka naam Batman Begins hai so I agree ki Bruce ki shuruaati life dikhana appropriate hai.
I think it's ironic that the mugger's name is Joe Chill, but he isn't  chill if he murders people.	Mere khyal se ye ironic hi hai ki mugger's name is Joe Chill , lekin wo chill nahi hai if he murders people.
unlikely yes, I think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be.  but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to   the bats	unlikely haan, mujhe lagta hai wo batman kaise bana k ek mysterious beginning dikhana chahte the, but phir bhi thodi mystery chhodna chahte the ke use bats ka phobia kaise hota hai.
very ironic. mr chill is more of a bone  chilling murderer. 	bahut ironic, mr chill to ek bone chilling murdered hai
He is also murdered too, so at least he gets what he deserves.	Uska bhi murder hojata hai, to kam se kam wo jo deserve karta hai use mil jata hai
he got whats coming to him. but  bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge 	Jo uske liye hona tha usko mil jata hai. But brucse uska murder nahi karta to main sochta hu wo uski badla leni ki chahat rah jaati hai.
I think it helps to establish that Bruce will not directly murder anyone. Even when he burns down the League of Shadows, he doesn't directly kill Ra's al Ghul.	Mujhe lagta hai iss ye establish hone me help hoti hai k Bruce kabhi kisi ka directly murder nahi karte. Even jab wo league of Shadows ko jala deta hai, Ra's al Ghul ko directly nahi maarta hai.
Injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder, in any case.	Injustice kabhi bhi murder ka reason nahi hona chaiye
I feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows, and to purge his fear of bats. this key part I think is pretty lucky break for him. as he is doing jail time in a foreign country.	Mujhe lagta hai ke wo lucky tha k league of shadows ka part ban gaya aur apne bats k dar ko hata diya.
It is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing...	Ye kaafi strange hai k uski family butler afford kar sakti hai but wo jail chor karne k liye jata hai
I really like Gary Oldman as Gordon. He plays a good cop really well.	Mujhe Gary Oldman as Gordon accha laga. Wo ek good cop accha play karta hai
What did you think of the Scarecrow scenes?	Tum Scarecrow wale scenes k baare me kya sochte ho?
The scarecrow was particularly scary character. trying to poison the water supply	scarecrow kafi scary character tha, water supply ko poison karne ki try kar raha tha
and batman was poisoned with the fear-inducing drugs, I thought it was over for him.	aur batman fear-inducing drugs se poisoned tha, mujhe laga uska sab over hai
It appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points, yeah.	haan, puri movie mein kafi points par aisa laga ki kafi character ke liye it was over
I was surprised when the real Ra's al Ghul showed himself, too. The League of Shadows doesn't die easily.	main bhi surprised tha jab asli Ra's al Ghul ne khud ko dikhaya.  League of Shadows asaani se nahi marta
He seems to have otherworldy power after surviving his past experiences	lagta hai past experience survive karne ke baad usme otherworldy power they
Hey	aho
Hi	HELLO
How’s it going?	KAISA CHAL RAHA HAI?
Pretty good. Are you a Marvel fan?	ACHA. KYA AAP MARVEL KA FAN HO?
Good to hear. Sure, what about you?	SUN KE ACHA LAGA. AAP KA BHAT KYA HAI?
Yes, I am a huge Marvel fan. One of my favorites is the Avengers. Mark Ruffalo is great as The Hulk. 	HA MAIN BAHOOT BADA MARVEL FAN HUH . AVENGERS MERA FAVORITE AUR MARK RUFFALO BAHOOT BADIA THA HULK JAISAA.
Sure, I liked the Avengers a lot.	TEEK HAI , MERE KHO BHI AVENGERS PASANDH HAI
I also think Ruffalo is a great Hulk.	MAIN BHI YE SOCH RAHA KI MARK RUFFALO BADIA HAI HULK KE LIYA.
Is Avengers the movie we’re supposed to talk about?	kya Avengers aesi Movie he ki hame iske bare me talk karna chahiye?
Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92% rating and average of 8/10. Yes, I believe so. 	Rottten Tomatoes ne ise 92% rating di he aur 8/10 ka average. ya , me aisa believe karta hu.
Okay then. Right, I’ve always experiened that IMDB gives movies a lower average rating than rotten tomatoes.	tab oke he. Right, me hamesha experience kiya he ki Rotten Tomatoes ke comparison me  IMDB movies ko lower average rating deta he.
Tha	not he it is tha
That's true	ye to sure he
But I guess 92 and 80 are a fair assesment.	but mujhe lagta he ki 92 aur 80 to fair rating assessment he.
Yeah, I think Joss Whedon was a good choice for director also. His vision was really inline with the comics. 	han, mujhe lagta he ki director ke liye bhi Joss Whedon good choice . uska vision comics ke sath vastav me inline tha.
Well, I can’t speak for the comics (haven’t read them), but this movie is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories.	well, me comics ke regarding to kah nahi sakta (me unhe read nahi kiya ke), but ye movies all heroes aur unki stories ka ek great mashup ke.
I guess it’s just a very good movie with an amazing plot.	meraguess ye he ki ye ek very good movie he amazing plot ke sath
I agree. 	me agree karta hu.
Loki using Clint Barton to help him with the Tesseract was awesome too. I like him even though he's a bad guy	Loki ka Clint Barton ko use karna  Tesseract ki liye help k liye bhi awesome tha. Mujhe wo pasand hai even though wo bad guy hai
Right, that was a great scene.	Haan, badhiya scene tha.
Loki’s a likable villain I’d say.	Main bolunga k Loki ek likable villain hai
It was interesting how it caused such a riff within The Avengers. Thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie. 	Avengers me uska kaha suni karwarna kaafi interesting tha. Thor ko movie k doran aise lag raha tha uske liye loyalty hai
You think?	Tum ye sochte ho?
I thought he was pretty ruthless with him.	Mujhe to laga wo uske saath kaafi ruthless tha
That’s just my opinion obviously.	Wo bas mera opinion hai obviously.
I can see that somewhat but he could have done a lot more damage if he wanted to. 	Main wo dekh sakta hu but mujhe lagta hai wo bahut jyada damagar kar sakta tha agar wo chahta wo
Do you have a specific example on mind?	Tumhare mind me koi specific example hai?
The end fight scene definitely was. He could have killed him. 	Wo end fight scene definitely. Wo use maar sakta tha.
Oh, the one where Hulk ends up hitting him?	oh wha kha hai jise hulk maar rha hai?
Yeah, that was classic. One of the funniest moments of the movie. I also liked when Iron Man fell back through the wormhole. It had everyone on edge I think. 	ha yeh classic tha film ke sabse majedar samay mai se ek muje bhi pasand aya maine wormhole ke madhyam se vapas gir gaya muje lgta hai ki yeh har kisi ke pass tha
Absolutely. Epic scenes.	bilkul mahakavya ke scenes hai
Can we talk about other movies or just this one?	kya hum isse movie ke bare mai charcha ker sakte hai?
You know, MCU	kya tum MCU jante ho?
I also like the way Nick Fury stood his ground with the Council. Just this one. 	muje bhi yeh pasand hai ki nick fury ne council ke sath apna ground bta diya sirk yeh ek
Understood.	samaj gya
Yeah, Fury’s great too.	ha fury bhi bhota bada hai
So, any final thoughts?	to koi akhri sujhav?
It's crazy that the Council wanted him to drop a nuclear missile into New York. 	ye crazy baat hai ki council chahti hai ki nuclear missile new york par gire
Great examples, man.	great udahran, man
It was great talking to another MCU fan.	Another MCU fan se talk karna great tha
Take care now!	now dhyan rakhna
Definitely! You too!	Definitely! tum bhi!

Hello! Isn't Monsters University a great movie? It was true to the spirit of Monsters, Inc. and matched its tone. 	hello... monsters university kya acha movie hien? kya vaakahi mein spirit of monsters sach hein, aur unka tone matched hein
I agree.  It was a good movie	mein maantha hoon.. badiya movie hein
What was your favorite part?	favorite part konsa hein?
I liked when Mike and Sully didn't finish the program and worked their way up the ranks anyways.	jab mike aur sully apne program finish nahi hote aur unhone saath ranks karne ke work kar rahe the, us scene ko muje pasand hein
Me too! It was very inspiring and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways. I liked how the movie expanded on the monster world. 	muje bhi! kitna inspiring hein yar, isse patha chaltha hein ki hum kaise apne dreams ko accomplish karthe jo jarur sach hoga... muje tho is movie ka monster world expanded bahut pasand hein
Yes.  The first movie only gave one facet of the world, while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree.	haan.. first movie ne yek facet world diya hein, second tho larger degree ko diya hein
When I heard they were making another Monsters Inc movie I expected a sequel, not a prequel. But I ended up loving it! Did you see it in theatres?	agar voh dusra monsters inc banaye tho jarur sequel he expect karenge pequel nahi,.. lekin end tho badiya hein.. aap theatres mein dekhe kya?
I don't think we saw it in the theatre.  I think we rented it.  It's been a while though.  I should show it to my kids.  They would probably like it.	theatre mein tho dekha yaad nahi hein... muje lagtha hum rented... bachon ko jarur dekhavunga..
I bet they would! I don't have kids but my coworkers do. I love Disney/Pixar movies so I recommend them to my coworkers a lot. 	jarur, mera pas kid nahi hei, lekin mere coworkers ke paas hein... muje disney pixar movies pasand hein, isliye mein apne coworkers ko jarur recommend karunga
I really enjoy Randy Newman's music on this, the Toy Story movies, and Finding Nemo/Dory.	randy newmans ka  music ko enjoy karunga, the toy story movies aur finding nemo/ dory
Me too! I think the Toy Story movies might be my favorite Pixar movies. Did you hear that they're building a Toy Story Land in Walt Disney World this summer? 	me bhi! toy story movies from pixar mere favorite movies hai.tereko pata hai kya wo log toy story land bana rahe hai walt disny world mai ye summer mai.
I did hear that.  It sounds pretty interesting.  	ha suna maine, acha hoga shayad
I'm going to WDW in the fall so I'm excited to see how the park is. Have you ever been? Or to Disneyland?	mai wdw ja raha hy, bahor excitement hai park dekhne ki, tu kabhi gaya hai ya disneyland ko ?
I've been to WDW a few times.  Never to Disneyland though.  California is pretty far away from me.  We went camping at WDW last year though.  It was great.	ha wdw ko kuch bar gaya hu, disney land ko nahi gaya. california dur hai mujhse.hum camping krne gaye the wdw pichle sal. maja aaya tha.
That's what I'm doing in the fall! I'm really looking forward to camping there!	wahi mai karne wala hu  ye fall mai,rah dekh raha hu camping krne ki
It was really great.  We camped for four nights I think.  It rained like crazy the first day, but it was still fun.	bahot mast hai. humne char rat camoing kiya, pehle din bahot barish giri,but maja aaya.
Do you like Mike or Sulley better?	tuzhe mike ya sulle mai se kon pasand hai jyada
Oh good question! I think I like Mike more. He's weirdly optimistic. 	acha sawal hai, mujhe mike jyada acha lagta hai. wo alag hi optimistic hai.
How about you?	tuzhe kya lagta hai
I like Mike because he's funnier.  He had some of the best lines in the first movie.	mujhe mike pasand hai kyu ki wo bahot funny hai. usme kuch behterin lines hai movie ke.
He is SO funny!! 	voh funny hein
I always liked John Goodman's voice acting for Sully, though. It's perfect for a big, fluffy monster	muje tho hamesha goodman ka voice pasand hein, big aur fluffy monster ke liye tho perfect hein
The part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard.	first movie ka end tho is part mein hein, jab voh microphone mein burps out kiya tho mera kids jor se has rahe they
I agree. John Goodman was a great choice for Sulley.	mein maantha hoon, john goodman ache choice hei sulley keliye
Hahah I bet!!! 	haha
I love the scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest. That was pretty neat	muje scare machien pasand hein, voh prequel mein hein, jo students ko frighten huve us contest keliye. pretty neat hein
Yeah, though I was really disappointed with Sulley for cheating.	haan, sulley ka cheating se kuch disappoint hein
I was too, that broke my heart. I cried when that happened!	mein bhi , mera dil tho thuth gaya. mein rone lage
It was really a cruel thing for him to do to MIke	yeh tho sach mein cruel thing hein mike keliye
It seemed a little out of character for Sulley, but I guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving.	sulley keliye tho yeh little out character hein, lekin conflict ke liye tho unke paas final source jarur hoga,
I agree, it was probably my least favorite part of the movie. I feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction.	mein maantha hoon, yeh probably mera least favorite part hein is movie mien.. muje lagtha hein ki yeh story kuch different direction mein ja raha hein
For Sully to trick Mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful! 	sully ko mike ko trick karne ko soch de tho voh dar gaya, kitna hurtful hein
I do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams though.  That's a good message that Disney started doing with the Princess and the Frog.	muje us ending bahut pasand hein, jo apne dream achieve karne ke liye itna hard se work kiya.. ache message hein,disney ka... disney tho princess and the frog se start kiya aise message dene
Me too! I like that common thread between the two movies. I think it was executed better in this though, because they really did start from the very bottom of Monsters, Inch	muje bhi in dono movies ka common thread pasand hein... muje lagtha yeh thoda better se executed kiya hein, kyon ki bottom of monster se start kiya
And it explains why they're always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie.  They were once in that same position.	aur in mein explain kiya ki kaise voh janitors ka original moives se ache hein... same position mein tho hein voh
Oh my gosh!!! I didn't even realize that! I have to rewatch the movie. You're totally right!	omg! muje realize hi nahi huva! mein is movie ko dubara dekhna pasand karunga.. aap bilkul sahi hein
It does show a really good message for kids, to be respectful of everybody	isme kids keliye ache message hein, jo respectful hein sabhi keliye
It's a valuable message.  Be kind and respectful to everyone.  Don't expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life.  Just be prepared to work your hardest.	in mein, valuable message hein, sabhi ke saath kind aur respectful hona.. apni credentials aur family reputation ke liye kabhi life mein lean mat hona.. sirf prepare se ho
Yes! I liked that they showed Sully as this spoiled brat at first who eventually learned that you can't always lean on your family's reputation. It can only get you so far	haan! muje bhi sully ka spoiled brat pehela pasand hein, jo apni family reputation ke liye kabhi lean nahi hota..
Maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition, because he didn't really realize the consequences of his actions, just did what he thought was right	lekin uska background thoda spoiled hein, kyon ki voh competition mein cheat kiy.. lekin unka action ka consequences nahi realize huva, bas kya use right laga voh kar baita
I feel like a lot of kids need that message these days.	I feel aajkal bahut se kids ko is meesage ki bahut jarurat hai.
You've got a good point there about the cheating.	tumhare pass bahut badhiya point hai cheating ke baare men.
And you have a good point there about kids needing that message!	aur aapke pass yah badhiya point hai is message ka kids ki jaruraton ke baare me.
I like that they had to work hard together too, so it didn't feel like so much of a struggle. Because Mike and Sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder	maine ye baat like ki ki unko sath milke hard work karna pada, so aisa feel nahi aaya ki ye koi jyada struggle tha. Because Mike and Sully ko ek dusre ke sath the unka struggle share karne me jab wo corporate  ladder chadh rahe the.

I really liked all the comedy in it. And the music	MUJE COMEDY PASAND AAYA, AUR USKA MUSIC BHI
The comedy is true to the spirit of Monsters Inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground. The music hit all the right notes I think	COMEDY THO TRUE SE US SPIRIT KA MONSTERS HEIN, KAAFI TONE SE MATCH KIYA JO KABHI OLD GROUND MEIN TURN NAHI HOTA.. MUSIC THO SAHI NOTES HEIN,
I agree, it was a very safe bet for Pixar with how they presented it.	MEIN MAANTHA HOON, YEH PIXAR KA SAFE BET HEIN, JIS TARAH VOH PRESENT KIYE
Superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money, though.	Superstar actors ka voice acting karna is always going to make money, though.
I agree, it has enough stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a good result.	Main agree karta hun, isme kafi stuff jo cuteness ke immediate buzz ke melt hone ke baad imagination ko haunt karegi. mere prequel ke liye ye acha result hai.
I liked the whole fraternity aspect of it, very tongue in cheek.	mujhe iska saara fraternity aspect acha laga, bohat tongue in cheek.
Yes, it was a refreshing outlook on the series as a whole and provided a nice background for the characters.	Han, ye ek as a whole series pe refreshing outlook tha aur characters ke liye nice background provide karti hai
I thought the scene of Mike at 7 years old was a good call-back too.	mujhe laga Mike ka 7 years old ka scene bhi acha call-back tha
I agree, I liked when they show Mike's background story of why he became a scarer. I always wondered why he chose to do that	I agree, mujhe acha laga jab unhone Mike ki background story dikhayi ki wo scarer kyun ban gaya. Main hamesha sochta hu usne aisa karna kyun chose kia.
I also like how they show the friendship between Mike and Sully develop	mujhe ye bhi acha laga ki kaise unhone Mike aur Sully ki friendship develop hote dikhaya
Yeah I never thought of Sully as the cool guy iike that	Haan maine kabhi nahi socha Sully ko is tarah cool guy
I didn't know Sully had such a pretentious  background compared to other characters. It explains why only he was accepted into Roar Omega Roar.	main nahi janta Sully ka baaki characters ke comparison mein itna pretentious background tha. Isse samajh aata hi sirf wahi kyun Roar Omega Roar mein accept huya.
True, and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are flawed.	Sach, aur ye ye dikhane ka acha kaam karti hai ki dono characters flawed hain.
I thought the whole Scare Games plot was a fairly good one too, kept it interesting.	mery khyal k mutabiq tamam khofnak game ka plot kafi achaa bhi tha, bht dilchasp rakha
I agree, I like that they didn't try to make them perfect. 	mai manta hun, mjhy acha laga k unhun ne unko oerfect banany ki koshish nai ki
Yes! And so much was at stake for them in that game as well	Han, aur unky lia bht kuch us game mai dao per bhi laga hua tha
It would decide if they could be renerolled or not. How do you feel about how Sully cheated?	ye faisla krega k kia wo reenrolled ho skty hain ya nai. apko kaisa laga k sully ne kaisy cheat kia
I thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment.	mery mutabiq ye anhooni ko sirf delay ker rha tha aur unhy accomplishment ki aik jhooti tasalli de rha tha
I agree, I felt bad for Mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was helped to win	mai manta hun, mjhy Mike k lia bura laga jo soch rha tha k wo khud se kamyaab hua jabky usy jeetny mai madad di gaye
I thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first challenge because another team was diqualified for cheating.	mery khyal tha k ye ironic bhi hai qk unhy phly muqabbly mai sirf is lia nikala gaya q k dusri team ko cheating kerny per disqualify kia gaya
Yes I agree. It ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as well	han ge mai manta hun. iska khatma unhy university se nikalny per he hua
I feel like they sacrificed themselves for the rest of the fraternity to get accepted though.	mjhy lagta ha k unhun ne baki tamam logon k accept hony ki waja se apni qurbani di hai
I agree and I think that it was a noble thing to do. At least they still were able to be hired at Monsters, Inc. and work their way up to becoming scarers.	mai manta hun aur mera khyal hai k ik acha kaam tha krny ko.kam az kam wo Monsters, Inc mai hire hony k qabil thy aur apny apko scarer banany tak phncha skty thy
Yeah, guess it shows that you don't need education sometime! Haha.	Han, guess ye dikhata hai ki sometimes tumhe education nahi chahiye! haha

At least they didn't get in a lot of trouble with the CDA	kam se kam ye CDA ke saath zyada trouble mein nahi pade

So Carreys character, Bruce Nolan, is a reporter. Hardworking, but not very successful. He has a lot of bad luck and reaches his limit when his co worker receives a promotion over him	So Carrey ka character, Bruce Nola, ek reporter hai. hardworking hai, but bahut successful nahi hai.

He then starts his complaints to God who ends up responding with the proposition that gives him his powers	Wo iske baad God se complain karta, God uski baat par respond karte hai aur ek option dete hai jisse uske pass power aa jati hai
So its like walk in someone else's shoes to see what they have to deal with.	So iska matlab ki kisi aur ke shoes pahan kar chalo taki pata lage ki kaisa lagta hai.

Batman rescued  here in this movie	Movie me Batman yanha rescued hua tha.
hopefully this went all out with the acting 	hopefully ye sab acting ke saath khatm ho jayega
 and graphics 	aur graphics
and just everything to be honest 	aur sab chhejo ke honest hone ke liye
It's pretty good. It's about 153 mins long	KAAFI ACHHA HAI. VAH LAGBAG 153 MINS LAMBA HAIN
Yes and i see it sasy that it is in between man of steel and dark night 	SAHI MUJHE LAGTHA HAI  KI YEH MAN OF STEEL AUR DARK NIGHT KE BEECH ME HAIN
I liked the sneak peak of Wonder Woman in here too. 	MUJHE WONDER WOMAN KE SNEAK PEAK BHI ACHHA LAGTHA HAIN
She appears in it too?	VAH US ME AATI HAIN
Yes. 	SAHI
It's pretty cool	WAH KAFI THANDA HAIN
That would be great 	VAH BAHUT ACHHA HOGA
I think Zack Snyder did a great job directing it 	MUJHE LAGTHA HAI ZAK SNYDER EK BAHUT ACHHA DIRECTING KA KAAM KIYA HAI
I have seen a few of his moveis 	MAIN UNKA KUCH MOVIES DEKHA HAI
He killed it with this one 	IS SE VAH USKO MAAR DIYA
 he does a great job with directing 	Wo direction ke saath bahut achha kaam krte hai
I agree with you 	Main tumse sehmat huin
Eisenberg played a good Lex Luther too 	Eisenberg ne Lex Luther ka bhi role bahut achhe se play kiya.
Hello!	Hello!
hey, what's up	Hey, kya chal rha hai
have you watched la la land before?	Kya tune la la land pehle dekhi hai?
Yes. I really appreciated how much thought went into the movie's title. I think it's really cool how it refers to Los Angeles, music, and having your head in the clouds all at once. It's really spectacular how they summed up so many elements of the movie in such a short title	Han, maine bht appreciate kiya ki movie ke name ke baare mein kitna socha gya hai. Mujhe achha lga ki kaise ye ek hi baar mein Los Angeles, music, or badalon mein sir dene ke baare mein btata hai. Yeh sach mein bahut badiya hai ki kaise movie ke chhote se titile mein itne saare elements ko pura kiya gya hai.
Have you seen it?	Kya tune dekhi hai?
yep -  i watched it because critics seemed to like it	han - Maine dekhi kyunki critics ko ye achhi lagi
I agree with most of the critics in the paper	Main jyadatar paper ke sabhi critics ke saath agree krta huin
Yes. I especially agree with the review that La La Land is successful at showing the hardships that are involved with chasing a dream	Han. Main sabse jyada iss review ke saath agree krta huin ki La La land successful rahi hai sapnon ko pura krne ke liye kiye gye hardships ko dikhane mein.
I disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull and that the middle was boring. I really found the entire movie to be enthralling. 	Mein unn do reviews se asahmat hu jinhone likha tha ki film dull hai aur beech ka part boring hai. Mujhe sach mein poori film enthralling lagi.
yep, i agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack, since they're not singers	han, mein aapse sehmat hu - mein ye maanta hu ki humko emma stone aur ryan gosling ko kuch slack kaatna chahiye kyuki wo singers nahi hain
Agreed. I really liked the scene where Sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing Christmas music only. 	Han, meine mana. Mujhe wah scene bohat achha laga jahan Sebastian jazz music improv karta hai jabki usko sirf Christmas music play karna chahiye.
It was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after I watched the movie	Ye unmein se ek scene tha jo film dekhne k baad bhi mere sath chipka reh gaya.
would you do that, if you were in his position?	tum kya karte, agar tum uski position mein hote?
I'm not sure. I liked how that was when Mia first heard Sebastian sing and was truly moved by it. I think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship	Mujhe sure nahi hu. Mujhe yah pasand aaya ki jab Mia ne pehli baar Sebastian ko gaate huye suna aur wo sach mein uss se move ho gayi. Mujhe lagta hai ye unki relationship ko start karne a interesting way tha.
yeah, it was just sad how he brushed her off, since things could've been different	han, ye sad tha ki usne usko brush off kar dia, warna baatein kuch alag hi hoti
I do like how the next time Mia sees Sebastian he is also singing. I also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing	Mujhe ye achha laga ki jab next time Mia ne Sebastian ko dekha wo bhi gana ga raha hai.  Mujhe ye bhi pasand aaya ki usne usko ek aisa gana request karke chidhaya kyuki usko pata tha ki usko wo gana gana achha nahi lagega
do you usually watch musicals?	Tum usually musicals dekhte ho?
Occasionally. I also enjoyed the development of Sebastian and Mia's relationship, such as when Mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because Sebastian suggests it to her. I feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship	kabhi kabhi.  Mujhe bhi Sebastian aur Mia ki relationship ka development achha laga, jaise jab Mia decide karti hai ki ab wo akele hi play karegi kyuki Sebastian ne usko aisa suggest kia. Mujhe laga ki wo dono bohat grow karte hain as individuals jab wo relationship mein aa jate hain
I enjoyed that part too, since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams	maine woh part bhi enjoy kiya, kyon ki yeh dikhata hai kitna hard ye donon kaam kar rahen hain apne dreams achieve karne ke liye
they both want to become successful in their separate areas, but they have to struggle a lot	donon chahte hain ki successful banen apne seperate ares mein, lekin bahut struggle karna padega
Right. I feel like the review that mentions the cruelty that's involved in following your dreams really sums it up. The film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big	Right. lagta hai review jo cruelty ko mention karta hai dreams ko follow karten hai sum karta hai.film afraid nahin karta hai ki kitna hard work aur hardship involve karta hai bada hasil karne ke liye
i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keith's offer	mujhe bhi laga ki sebastian keo keith ka offer difficult laga
i mean, he gets paid, but it's not something he wants to do. This happens in life a lot	mera matlab hai, use payment milta hai lekin woh hai nahin karna chahta hai.  ye bahut hota hai life mein
I agree. It must be hard to do something you're not passionate about- especially when it's something you must do in order to one day live out your dreams	main agree karta hoon. hard lagta hoga kuch karne kojab tum passionate nahin hoge- especially jab tumhe kuch karna hoga tumhe ek din live karna hai dreams ke liye
What did you think of the scene when Mia and Sebastian get into a fight about Mia thinking Sebastian is giving up on his dreams?	kya laga tumhe woh scene jab Mia or Sebastian fight karne lage jo Mia soch rahi thi Sebastian drams ko chod raha hai?
it was definitely well acted, and i sympathize with both of them	usme ekdum acchi acting thi, lekin sympathize karta hoon donon se
but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful	mujhe lagta hai sebastian harsh tha jab usne mia se kaha ki woh use aur pasand karta tha jab woh unsucessful tha
It truly was heartbreaking when Mia moved back home to Nevada	truly woh heartbreaking thi jab Mia vapas Nevada ghar mein gayi
i feel he didn't want to hear the truth, because he was really giving up on his dreams	muje lagtha hein ki voh sach jaan ne mein hiskis hein, kyon ki voh apna dream ko give up karta hein
it really was sad	voh toh bura huva
I agree. It was also a very unpredictable plot twist. I did not see it coming at all	mein maantha hoon. voh toh unpredictable plot twist tha. muje toh patha hi nahi chala ki voh aap raha hein
would you say that was the low point in the movie?	kya tuje aisa laga ki voh low point ka movie hein?
Yes but I wouldn't say any part of the movie "sagged badly" as one review claims	haan, lakin  muje lag raha hai ki koi sagged badly ko review karega
i agree - overall, i would recommend the movie to a friend	haan maantha hoon, overall mein toh apni friend ko is movie ko recommend karunga
I agree. As another review points out it was a "genuinely romantic comedy", which I completely agree with because I feel as though Sebastian and Mia's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies. I appreciated the realness of their relationship	mein bhi. toh dusra review point mein toh voh "genuinely romantic comedy" bola tha , jo mein completely agree karunga kyon ki muje lagtha hei ki Sebastian aur Mia ka relationship toh cliche nahi hein jo love stories mein huva hota hein. lakin voh relationship toh mein realness se appreciate karunga
yes, that was one thing i loved about the movie - while it was sad, it was not a cliche ending	haan, yehi toh muje is movie se pasand aaya- voh toh sad tha lakin cliche ending bana
I agree. I think Damien Chazelle really did a good job directing the film. 	mein maantha hoon. muje lagtha ki Damien Chazelle ne is film ko ache directing ki
i'm curious, are you an ai	mein toh curious hoon, aap?
if so, i was completely fooled	agar aisa hai, to mujhe poori tarah se fool bnaya gaya
I am not! 	main nahi hu
But I really was surprised that someone reviewed Sebastian as a "jazz snob" because I did not get that vibe at all	lakin main bilkul surprise hu ki kisi ne Sebastian ko as a "jazz snob " reviewed kiya kyun ki mujhe wo vibe bilkul bhi nahi mili
yeah, i disagreed with that characterization, but i can see why someone might say that.	haan, main disagree hu us characterization ke stah, lakin main dekh saktu hu kyun kuch log aisa keh sakte hai
he is a purist, or whatever they called it in the film	wo ek purist hai, ya phir jo kuch bhi unhone use film main bulaya
I also really didn't think Mia's character lacked depth. I think she was a rather round character, especially with the large amount of independence she possessed. It took a lot of courage for her to move back to Nevada	mujuhe bhi aisa nahi lagta ki Mia ka character depth main lack karta hai. Mujhe lagta hai balki wo round character thi, especially usne  large amount of independence ke sath usne possessed kiya. Use bahut zada courage lagi hogi wapas Neveda ke main wapas jane ke liye
yes, i thought her character was pretty nuanced, but i'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to Nevada. After the play didn't go well, I think that was her only option	hann, mujhe lagta hai ki uska character pretty nuanced tha, lakin main sure nahi hu ki ye uke liye courageous hai wapas Nevada move hona. play ke sahi na jane ke baad, mujhe lagta hai uske paas keval yahi option tha.
*about it	iske bare main
I suppose you have a point. I just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didn't cling on to Sebastian when things didn't work out for her. 	mujhe lagta hai ki apke paas pont hai. Mian sochta hu ki wo zada independent thi average woman se jaisa ki film main portray kiya gaya kyunki jab chieze uske liye work out nahi ki wo Sebastian ke upar chipki nahi
although I wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams	halaki main wish karta hu ki vain apne dreams ko achieve karne se pehle reconcile kare
the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad	end me jo dikhaya ki actually me kya ban sakta hai usse maine kafi sad feel kiya
I agree! It was very sad but also, as one reviewer puts it quite "bittersweet." I wasn't sure how to feel at the end. 	I agree! Yah bahut sad tha but also ek reviewer ne jaise bataya ki yah quite bittersweet ha. Mai sure hi nahi tha ki ant me mai kya feel karu.
It was nice discussing the film with you! Have a great day!	aapke sath film discuss karke achcha laga! Hava a great day!
you guys have a pretty good ai system	aap logon ke pass ek badhiya ai system hai
i was actually completely fooled	completely fool ban gaya tha actually me

Hello	Hello
Hello	Hello
I just watched Batman vs. Superman, have you seen it yet?	Maine abhi Batman vs. Superman dekhi, Aapne dekhi hai abhi tak?
No I haven't	No, Maine nahi dekhi
It's the first movie like this with Batman and Superman together.	Yeh Batman aur Superman ki sathme aisi pehli movie hai.
That sounds good	Sunkar achha laga
Batman is played by Ben Affleck.  He gets tricked into fighting Superman.	Batman ka role Ben Affleck ne nibhaya hai. Use Superman ke sathme ladai karne ka trick milka hai.
Who plays Superman?	Superman ka role kisne nibhata hai?
Henry Cavill.  Wonder Wo man is in it too.	Henry Cavill. Wonder kaun sath me hoga.
I like him, he's a good actor.	Mujhe wo pasand hai, Wo ek achha actor hai.
I love Wonder Woman. Who plays Wonder Woman?	muje wonder woman pasand hai.wonder woman kaun play kar raha hai
I'm not sure of her name, b ut Laurence Fishburne and Holly Hunter are in it too.	mai uske nam par sure nahi hu.lekin  sayad Laurence Fishburne aur HolLy Hunter  ho sakta hai
I like both of them. The movie sounds good. How long is it?	mai un dono ko pasand karta hu movie ki sound achi hai  aur kitna der
It's 153 minutes so it's fairly long.  There's a part where Bruce Wayne/Batman seeks out kryptonite in the Indian Ocean as a deterrent.	ye 153 minut so long .yaha yek hissa jaha way/batmanne indian ocean me krytonite paya
It didn't get very good critics scores.	ishe bahut acha critic score nahi mile
That is a long movie. I enjoy long movies, especially in the theaters. It sounds interesting. What did the critics have to say about it?	yah yek lambi moive hai ,muje lambi moive pasand hai khaskar theater me ,iski sounds majedar hai.kritic ne iske bare me kya kaha
CinemaScore graded it as a B, Rotten Tomatoes 4.9/10 and Metacritic Score was 44/100. One of the critics said it wasn't as good as Dark Knight but it was better than Man of Stee.	cinema score ne ishe b grad diya,rotten tomatoes ne 4.9/10 aur  Metacritic  ne 44/100,yek critic ne khayah ki ye dark night jaisi achi nahi par man of steel se achi hai
Steel.	istel
Wow. Those are really low scores! I am surprised at that. Usually these types of movies are popular and do well.	wah ye to vastav me kam score hai.vaise jayadatar eshi moives popular hoti hai aur acha pradsan karti  hai
Yeah, agreed.  In one part of the movie, Superman's mom gets kidnapped and the kidnapper demands he kill Batman for his Mom's release.	ha mai manta hu moive ke yek hisse maisuperman ki mom kidnap huyi aur kidnaper ne kaha ki vo uski maa ke badle batman ko marega
And what happens once his mom is released?	aur phir uski mom release hone k baad kya hoga?
She isn't released that way, because Batman realizes right before he kills Superman that they are both being tricked.  Batman ends up rescuing Superman's Mom, and Superman goes after the kidnapper.	Wo waise release nahi hoti hai, kyuki Batman Superman ko maarne se theek pahle samjh jata hai k dono ko trick kiya gaya hai. Batman Superman ki mom ko bachata hai aur superman kidnapper k peeche jata hai
Does Superman have a fight with kidnapper?	Kya Superman kidnapper k sath ladta hai?
And who wins	Kaun jeetta hai?
Yes, Superman confronts the kidnapper, whose name is Luthor, played by Jesse Eisenberg, on the Kryptonian scout ship.	Haan, Superman kidnapper ko confront karta hai, jiska naam Luthor hai, Jesse Eisenberg ne play kiya hia, Kryptonian scout ship pe
That sounds exciting. Is Wonder Woman in the movie a lot?	Kaafi exciting sound karta hai. Kya is movie me Wonder Woman kaafi hai ?
Luthor gets arrested and then Batman goes to visit him in prison.  I don't want to tell you the outcome of the fight because I don't want to ruin the ending.  No, Wonder Woman doesn't have a very big part.	Luthor arrest hojata hai phir Batman usse visit karne jail me jata hai. Main tumhe fight ka outcome nahi batana chahta kyuki main ending ruin nahi karna chahta. No, Wonder Woman ka bahut bada part nahi hai
I love Wonder Woman! Yes, don't give away the outcome because I want to see it! 	Mujhe Wonder Woman bahut pasand hai! Haan, outcome mat batao kyuki mujhe ye movie dekhni hai
I think you'll really like it.  I don't always believe the critics, you never know what else is going on with them.	Mujhe lagta hai tumhe bahut pasand aayegi. Main critics ki baat hamesha nahi maanta, pata nahi kya chal rah hai unke sath.
I think I would too. I try not to listen too much to them either. I have seen some really good movies that the critics just rip to shreds. 	Mujhe bhi wahi lagta hai. Main bhi unki jyada baat nahi sunta. Maine kaafi bahut acchi movies dekhi hai jiski critics ne dhajjia uda di thi.
There may have been a movie coming out the same weekend they were friends with the director or something loke that.	Ho sakata hai usee veekend koee philm aa rahee ho jisamen ve nirdeshak se dostee kar rahe the ya kuchh aisa kar rahe the.
like	Pasand
Well I hope you enjoy it.  If nothing else, it is a must-see just to have Batman and Superman fighting.	Vaise mujhe ummeed hai ki aap ise pasand karenge. agar aur kuchh nahin, yah sirph baitamain aur suparamain kee ladaee hai.
I think I will enjoy it! 	Mujhe lagata hai ki main isaka aanand loonga!
Okay it's been good chatting with you.  Have a great day!	Theek hai, aapake saath achchhee chaiting huee. aapaka din achchha rahe!
You too!! Thank you 	Aap bhi !! dhanyavaad

Hello	hello
Hi	hi
So the movie we're talking about is Inception	so ham jis movie ke bare me baat kar rahe hai wo inception hai
Have you seen it?	tumne dekhi hai kya
What is the movie about? I haven't seen it	yah movie kis bare me hai? maine dekhi nahi hai
The movie is a scientific movie about people who infiltrate the subconscious of individuals and obtain information in the dream world. Basically they enter into someone's dreams to find out information.	Ye movie ek scientific movie hai, un logo ke baar me jo logo ke subconscious mind me infiltrate karte hai aur unke sapno ki duniya se information jutate hai. Basically wo kisi ke sapno me jaakar information nikalte hai.
Seems like an interesting movie, have you watched it?	Ye ek interesting moive lag rahi hai, Kya tumne dekhi hai?
Yeah, I've seen it. It's directed by Christopher Nolan if you've heard of him.	Yeah, maine dekhi hai. Ise Christopher Nolan ne direct kiya hai agar tumne unke bare me suna ho.
I think he also directed The Dark Knight among other things	Mujhe lagta hai unhone The Dark Kninght ko bhi dusri chhejo ke saath direct kiya hai.
Inception also has a rotten tomatoes score of 86% which is really high.	Inception ka bhi rotten tomatoes par score 86% hai, jo ki kafi high hai.
I love his movies, his a pretty good director, what about the cast of the movie?	Mujhe unki moives pasand hai, wo pretty good director hai, Is movie ke cast ke baare me kya hai?
Leonardo DiCaprio is in it along with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy. All pretty big names.	Leonardo DiCaprio bhi isme hai with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page aur Tom hardy ke saath. Sabhi kafi bade naam hai.
Yeah, pretty good actors. 	Yeah, kafi acche actors.
I like their movies as well	Mujhe unki bhi moives pasand hai
sounds like a good combination	Ye ek accha combination sound hota hai.
what about the other movie ratings?	Doosara movie rating ke bare me kya rai hai
IMDB rates it 8.8/10	IMDB rating me 8.8/10 aatha hai
Which is also pretty high I think	woh bahut achha hai ,mujhe eisa lagtha hai
Do you want to know more of the plot or a scene?	aap kiske bare me jan na chahthe ho , plot or drshya?
Yeah it seems like a high rating, what was your favorite scene?	lagtha hai is ka rating achha high ,aap ka pasandeeda drshya kaun si hai
So there's this scene where multiple people are going into a dream. So they need to have someone "kick" them awake at the same time to escape. However, someone gets wounded in the dream  and are almost dying and they get sent into "limbo".	scene me bahut sare aadmi swapn me kho jaath hai .koi unko jagane aur bachane ki zaroorat hai. par koi log swapn me ghaayal ho gaye aur marnevale the aur  "limbo" ho jaathe hai.
and what happens if the die in the dream? what are the consequences of this	kya hoga agar woh swapn me mar jaathe hai tho? uska natheeja kya hoga
They basically are stuck there until someone can wake them up in the real world. So in the movie, even though it was only a few hours of real time, two of the characters spent fifty years in the "limbo" world, where they had to construct it based on their shared memories.	woh fass jaathe hai, jab tak unhe koi nai jaga tha aur duniya me le aatha.is movie me bale asli duniya kuch ghante ke liye hai ,par do character pachas saal "limbo" duniya me tha, gayee yaadon par banan pada.
And whats the role of Leonardo Di Caprio in this film?	Leonardo Di Caprio ka is film me kya role hai?
Im guessing he has the leading role	mujhe lagtha hai achhi role hai.
Yeah he's the lead actor. His name is Dom Cobb and he specializes in conning secrets from victims in their dreams.	Haan woh lead actor hai. Uska naam hai Dom Cobb aur uska specialization hai conning secrets from victims unke dreams mein.
One more thing about the "limbo" world is that eventually people forget that the world they are in is not real.	"limbo" world ke baare mein ek aur cheez hai ki eventually log bhool jaate hain ki jis duniye mein wo hain wo real nahi hai.
So they can't distinguish between a dream and what is real.	To wo dream aur real ke beech mein distinguish nahi kar sakte.
Even when they "wake up" in a dream, they are still in the dream even if they don't realize it.	Even agar woh dream mein "wake up" bhi ho jaate hain to bhi  wo dream mein hi hote hain even if they don't realize it.
Seems like a really interesting concept	really interesting concept  lagta hai
Im getting interested in the movie	Main movie mein interested ho raha hun
so far the plot seems great and the cast seems pretty good as well	ab tak to plot seems great aur cast bhi kaafi acchi lag rahi hai
also the director	director bhi
Yeah it's a pretty quality movie	Yeah woh kaafi acchi quality ki movie hai
I can tell you more about the plot if you want?	Agar tum chaho to mein plot ke baare mein aur bata sakta hun ?
Yeah, that would be great	Woh great hoga
tell me more about it	Is ka baremein aur batayiye
So there are things called totems	To totem nam ka cheesen hote hai
They basically are an object that reminds someone that they are dreaming	Yeh basically ek object hota hai jo jis ka sapna dekh rahe hai us ko remind karta hai
something that roots them to the real world	Aisa cheez jo real world mein le jaye
Interesting, I think I will give the movie a chance and watch it, It seems worth my while.	Yeh to interesting hai, mujhe lagta hai ki mein ye movie dekhoonga, yeh mere time ke liye worth hai

Oh yeah! That's right. So many great actors in this movie	Oh haan! wo sahi hai. Itne saare badhiya actors hai is movie me .
And they all looked so cool in their mafia suits	Aur wo sab apne mafia suits me itne cool lag rahe the
The movie has such an authentic criminal world feel to it. (cough cough) not that I would know what the criminal underworld looks like 	Is movie me bilkul authentic criminal feel hai. ( cough cough) waise mujhe to nahi pata criminal underworld kaisa hai
hahaha uh oh	hahaha uh oh
oh and the Mustang was SICK!	oh aur Mustang to khatarnaak thi

You should try to discuss the new paragraph when the document has changed. You will have 3 turns of conversation with your partner on each of the documents. You will be given 4 documents each containing a short paragraph. The new paragraph might show just beneath the previous document. The next document will be loaded automatically after you finish 3 turns discussing the current document. You cannot use information you personally know that is not included there. You can use any information given in the document in the conversation.	muje lagtha hein ki, aap new paragraph ke baare mein discuss karna chahiye. aap ke paas 3 turns ka conversation hein jo aap apne partner ke saath discuss kar sakthe. aapko 4 documents deye jaayega, aur sabhi mein short paragraph hoga. nahi paragraph mein pehele document bhi ho saktha hein. agli document apne aap se load hoga jab 3 document khatam hoga. lekin us information ko aap use nahi kar sakthe. aur document ka conversation ko kuch info use bhi nahi hota.
oh, i only see one document on home alone 	acha, tho mein yek document ghar mein dekh loonga
we messed up we only get 3 replies each page.... i think it was an epic movie! lol kevin is my fav character and i think its not fair to call it adult bashing that sounds like a response from a parent whos kid beats their ass lol at the bottom click tasks thats where i found that 	mein tho messed up kiya ab mere paas 3 replies yek page mein hein.. mein soch raha tha ki yeh epic movie hei! lol kevin tho mera fac character hein , mein soch raha tha ki usse aduld kehela itna basing sound nahi kartha kyon ki jab koi apne parent apne kid ko maartha tho dusron ko kaise lagthe vaise hi muje bhi laga
john hughes was the director , right ?	john hughes director tha, right ?
i didnt like the adult bashing comment either, i didnt see that. they were robbers	mujhe bhi adult bashing comment acha nahi laga, maine wo nahi dekha. wo sab robbers they.
scroll to the bottom of the document... and at the bottom of this chat box it says tasks.... we get 3 chat responses each page we are shown.... 	document ke bottom ko scroll karo... aur chat box ke bottom mein it says tasks... hame 3 chat responses milte hai har page par jo hame shown hai

Did you agree with the rotten tomatoes rating of the movie?	kya tum movie ki rotten tomatoes rating se agree karte ho?
not at all. id give the movie a 10/10 its something i was raised on lol my mom used to put it on to shut me up	bilkul nahi. main movie ko 10/10 dunga. main isey dekh kar bada hua hu lol meri mom mujhe ye chalakar mujhe shut up karti thi
the document says its not realistic bc kevin would need tons of money to set those traps... i think thats bs.. his family DOES have money lollolol everything he used he had laying around his parents giant house 	document kehta hai ye realistic nahi kyunki kevin ko kafi money chahiye traps set karne ke liye..mujhe lagta hai ye bs hai..uski family ke paas paisa hau lollolol jo bhi usne use kia wo uske parents ke giant house mein pada tha
Right, i did not agree that they were traps that any 8 year old could come up with. not at all in my opinion	han, main agree nahi karta ki wo traps 8 saal ka bacha bana sakta hai, mere opinion mein bilkul nahi
Did you like that the movie had a Christmas theme?	kya tumhe acha laga ki movie ka Christmas theme tha
i also like the scene where Kevin slaps his cheeks with the after shave and then screams because it was so unexpected and hilarious	muje us scene ko pasand hein jab kevin apne aap ka cheeks maar raha tha jab shave ke baath aur chilla rehatha.. vaakahi mein unexpected aur hilarious hein
thats true. i dont think an 8 year old would come up with those but i dont think he would have "needed his own money" either i think xmas was perfect they were traveling for the holidays.. i prefer the other one tho where hes stuck in NYC 	sach yar.. muje nahi lagtha ki 8 saal bacha is tarah ka soch lekhe aayega, jarur usse money ka jaruri hoga ya usse xmas ka holidays ache tarah travel karna chatha hoga..
home alone is a 1990 film! i was born in 1990 lol NOW I FEEL OLD 	home alone tho 1990 ka film hein.. mein jab born huvi thi lol ab muje old ke tarah feel hota hein
lol....yes home alone is a 1990 film and i was 15	lol.. haan home alone 1990 ka film hein,. jab mein 15 ki thi
 Kate discovers mid-flight that Kevin is missing, how stupid llolol made for a funny movie but how can you forget a kid at home lol 	kate ne tho mid flight mein he discover kiya ki kevin missing hein.. kaise stupid hein yar..  lekin movie tho funny hein kyon ki kon aise apne kid ko bhultha hein
I know...i was just thinking about that too, how they had to rush around in the movie because they overslept, and then just counted heads and thought they had kevin. i cant imagine having that many kids that i could ever forget one 	muje patha hein.. mein bas aise soch rahi thi ki is movie kahi rush nahi hein kyon ki sab sleep kar rahe they aur achanak koi count karne laga tho kavin nahi tha..
you were 15 lollollol omg i was born in feb of 1990 -with two would-be burglars played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. i think they were perfect for the part! hysterical 	kya aap 15 ke the.. omg mein tho 1990 feb mein born huva-- joe pesci aur daniel stern dono play kara.. voh tho perfect part hein hysterical ka
i was just about to say something about the actors who played the burglars....i really enjoyed Joe Pesci character in the movie. 	mein burglars ke baare mein bol raha tha.. muje p=joe pesci ka character is movie mein pasand hein
i do not agree that the first half was flat either. i think it was a great movie from beginning to end 	muje first halk ko pasand nahi hein.. lekin beginning se end tak badiya movie hein
lol you leeeeft me 	lol.. aap tho aise hi chod diya
It sounds like a good movie. It sounds like it is a good monsters inc successor.	acha movie ke tarah sound kartha. successor ke liye tho ache monsters sound kartha
I agree. I'm slightly disappointed by the Rotten Tomatoes score. Then again, it is the first time that Pixar has made a prequel film. 	mein mantha hoon. lekin rotten tomatoes ka score se mein disappointment hoon. kyon ki yeh pixar ka first time hein prequel film ko banane mein
Do you typically watch movies like Monster's University?	tho aap typically monster university movie ke tarah dekhte hein?
Typically no since i generally like to watch anime. But if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid. Then I usually will make a effort to see it.	typically nahi yar, kyon ki muje anime ko dekhna pasand hein., jab  mein kid tha, jab franchise kar letha. baaki tho mein effort kartha usse dekhne pe
And i agree those scores kinda seem rather low.	haan, aur unka scores tho low thi rehatha
I understand. Just by glancing at the ratings, do you think you'd make an effort to go see the prequel? Or would the score discourage you from seeing the film?	mein understand kartha hoon, lekin ratings tho just glancing hein, tho aap prequel ka dekhne ka effort karenge? ya score ka discourage aap is film nahi dekhenge?
Id still see it despite bad reviews. I generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not. Like if 99% of people say its bad or good. I usually won't follow what i hear. I just go and experience it for myself. And then from there I usually say its cool or  say its bad.	mein still is bad reviews ko despite kartha. mein apne aap ko decide kartha, muje pasand hein ya nahi. 99% people tho ache ya bura hi bolte. jo mein usually follow nahi kartha. mein apne aap jaatha aur experience kartha, fir mein usually acha ya bad kahatha
Makes sense. I typically only pay attention to the ratings when it's a director who I am familiar with. If I know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings, I usually will wait to hear from friends/family before paying to see it. 	make sence. mein typically ratings par attention kartha, koun director familiar aisa. lekin agar mein phenomenal ka work dekhe tho particular movie tho awful rating hei, mein usually family aur friends ke review suntha hoon
Also im a fan of comedy movies. So I'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes.	mein bhi comedy movies ka fan hoon,. probably muje memes aur jokes ko enjoy kartha
Ya same.	mein bhi
Comedy movies are always a must see in my book. 	comedy movies tho hum book mein hi dekhte
And if im being honest, pixar usually makes good movies so I have good expectations. Illumination movies is what im " iffy" about.	agar mein honest hoon tho, pixar ko ache movies ko ache hi keheta aur muje unme ache expectations hein. illumination movies tho iffy hote
I love that Monster's University has a fraternity involved. Even more so love it because they call it Roar Omega Roar.	muje monster's university paand hein unka fratenity involved hein. muje roar omega roar bhi pasand hein
Mike is 7???? What in the...I never knew that.	mike ka 7??? itna bhi kya hein... mein kabhi suna nahi
ya that name is great.	haan, name badiya hein
He's only seven when he goes on the field trip. He goes to college eleven years later. So he'd be eighteen.	voh 7 saal ke hein, jab voh field trip kar raha tha. voh 11 years ka baad college gaya. tho 18 ke hei ab
I misread that at first too. 	mein first ka misread kiya
ahhh I see well that clears that up.	ahh, tho mein saari clearsup dekh lunga
Looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities. 	lagtha hein ki movie thoda heavily cartoon fraternities hoga
yep	yap
I find it odd that Pixar has a scene in this movie where Sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores. Doesn't really promote the whole 'fair play' imagine to their age demographic. 	muje odd laga, is movie mein pixar ke liye yek scene hein waha, sulley tampers ka machine badiya score hein.. us age demographic ke liye tho really fair play nahi promote kartha
Oozma Kappa. I can't believe they threw a kappa meme in there.	oozma kappa.. muje yakin hi nahi aatha ki voh kaapa ko meme banaye
Every movie with a fraternity/sorority always contains 'Kappa.' Ever notice that?	kappa ko saari movies mein fraternity/ sorority hein.. kya aap notice nahi kiya
ya. Its pretty much a dead meme.	haan.. dead meme yar
Am i slow for thinking hardscrabble was male until this passage? lol	kya mein slow hoon think karne mein, us male hi hardscrabble hein us passage tak?lol
Wonder what CDA stands for in this movie. Clearly, it's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have? 	CDA tho is movie ke liye stand kiye hein.. clearly, is tarah form tho enforcer hein, kis tarah ka enforcer is monster mein hein?
idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough.	kuch scary tarah ho sakthe hein
Nope! I thought the same. I think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph. 	nahi! muje bhi aise laga. kyon ki inme gender context tho nahihein,
yeah probably.	haan
Well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids.	kids keliye tho yeh safe movie sound kartha
No, I don't think it's to make sure they're scary enough... the CDA has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university. 	nahi, muje nahi lagtha ki yeh itna bhi scary hein.... voh  CDA tho campus se nikhalne vaale the kyon ki university ka expulsion ho raha tha
Although i  expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there.	although, mein tho expect kar rahi thi ki koi hidden adult jokes jo college mein hota tha aur fraternity tho muje yek ya do slip karne ke liye think karaya
Ah i see that would make sense.	ah, ab kuch sense huva
I agree. I was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesn't coincide  with a kids film and what you'd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monster's actions,. 	mein maantha... mein tho is movie ka cheating portion ko skeptical laga. lekin kids film ke liye tho coincide nahi hein aur is age mein aap kya kids ko teach karenge, lekin is monster action tho thoda negative reinforcers hein
True. Movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them.	sach. aaj kal ka movies tho formulaic tropes aur kids ke pickup se he banate
I hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable.	i hope ki movie fresh se stays karthe aur thoda unpredictable bhi hein
Keep the kids on their toes.	kids ko apne toes ke saath hi rakhna chahiye
One can only hope. 	yek tho jarur hope rahega
And still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it.	aur still parents tho smart enough hein enjoy karne se
A 79% on a kids movie doesn't seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes.	mera opinion se 79% kids movie tho itna bad nahi rahatha, us key scenes ke read karne ke baath
Thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good. And still seem better than movies today.	isliye past pixar film mera opinion se ache hein.. still aajkal ka movies se better hein
Thats true. I think overall it sounds like a good movie.	voh tho hein.. overall muje ache movie sound kartha
Hey, what did you  think of the movie?	hey, tum movie ke baare me kya sochte ho?
I like that it is a true story.	mujhe ye pasand hai ki ye ek true story hai.
Yeah, very cool. I loved it but I like con-man films in general. Leonardo DiCaprio was great.	yeh, very cool. mujhe ye pasand hai par mujhe in general con-man pasand hai. Leonardo DiCaprio mahan the.
Did you like the movie.	kya tumhe movie pasand aayi.
The acting...Leo, Hanks, Walkin...was great.	The acting.. leo, hanks, walkin .. mahan the
Yeah I thought Dicaprio was great. But I think Tom Hanks made the movie super good.	yeah mujhe lagta hai ki Dicaprio mahan the. But mujhe lagta hai ki Tom Hanks ne movie ko super good bana diya.
Yeah. And your true story point is good. I wonder what the real Frank Abagnale is like.	Yeah. aur aapka true story wala point accha tha. Mujhe aashcharya ki real Frank Abagnale kaise the
Supposibly just like the character played by Dicaprrio.	Supposibly jaisa ki character Dicaprrio dwara play kiya gaya.
He must be funny. Movie was a crack-up. Very easy to watch. 	We funny  hona chahiye. Movie crack-up the. Watch karne me bahut easy.
I wonder if someone could still get away with something like that today.	muje abhi bhi yakin nahi hota ki koi aise kaise jaa sakthe hein
Probably could become POTUS these days.	probably voh POTUs ban jaathe hein
I wonder If the real guy is still alive.	muje tho abhi bhi yehsas nahi hota ki voh ab bhi alive hein
Good chance he is. Movie wasn't set too long ago.	acha chance usko mila.. movie tho itna bhi lambha nahi tha
To think the guy was only 19 years old when he started.	jab vo 19 saal ka tha tab shuru huva
Yeah. Scorcese is a great director. I like it when great ones take on lighter, funnier plots. No reason to be serious all the time.	haan.. scorcese tho badiya director hein.. muje is tarah ka director bahut pasand hein.. yeh thoda lighter aur funnier plots dethe.. kabhi serious nahi hote.
Hey the guy was convincing enough to get a job with American World airways.	are yeh guy tho american world airways ka job ko hi convince kar raha hein
Probably helps that he was young. You're braver and more confident at that age.	probably yeh tho young hein.. aap tho braver aur jyada confident hon in age mein bhi
He was also young when he went to prison.	voh tho young hein lekin voh prison mein hein
It is really great that the FBI hired him as a investigator years later.	acha huva ki FBI ne usse hired kiya aur usse investigator banaya
The twist of ending up working for the FBI is great. Reminds me of JFK's dad. He made a fortune insider trading (it was not illegal at the time) and then FDR made him the first commisioner of the SEC, where he was great at busting insider traders.	Movie me end me uska FBI k liye kaam karne wala twist badhiya hai. Mujhe JFK ke dad ki yaad dilata hai. Usne insider trading karke bahut paisa kamaya (tab wo illegal nahi tha) aur phir FDR ne us SEC ka pahla commisioner bana diya, jaha wo insider traders pakadne me maahir tha
Yes. It is almost the same story.	Haan. Ye same story jaisi hi hai
I like Martin Sheens role.	Mujhe Martin Sheen ka role accha laga
Everyone's a sucker for redemption flicks. This film must have made a fortune. 	Har kisi ko redemption flick acchi lagti hai. Is movie ne bahut paisa kamaya hoga.
Wellhe made a fortune in the movie.	Well usne to kamaya hi hoga.
People say the real guy made a lot of money inventing new ways of stopping cons.	Log kehte hai asli aadmi ne cons ko rokne k naye tareeko se bahut paisa kamaya
Makes sense.	Makes sense
Everyone loves a happy ending too.	Aur har kisi ko happy ending bhi pasand hoti hai
Sort of reminds me of Forest Gump.	Ye mere ko Forest Gump remind karata hai
DId you stay for the ending? They reveal the real guy then.	Tum ending k liye ruke the? Wo tab asli aadmi ko reveal karte hai.
During the credits, I mean.	Credits ke time, mera matlab
OH Yeah. Saw the photo of the real guy.	OH Yeah. Asli bande ki photo dekhi.
A real good movie. 	Ek kafi acchi movie.
Hey	namaste

Yeah it's so crazy haha. makes you feel old	Haan ye bahut crazy hai. khud ko old feel hota hai

The back story for Mike was kind of sad	Mike ki back story kafi sad type ki thi.
Indeed. It is an interesting story. Seeing this boy go from poverty and sleeping on someone's couch to college prospect, and then professional player was inspiring	Indeed. ye bahut interesing story hai. Is boy ko poverty ke dauran kisi aur ke couch par sote dekhne se uske college prospect tak, aur then professional player bante dekhna bahut inspiring tha.
I'm sure the movie inspired a lot of other young athletes	I am sure is movie ne dusre young athletes ko bhi bahut inspire kiya hoga.
Understandably	Yeh understandable hai.
I think it's incredible that this family took him in like that	Mujhe yeh incredible lagta hai ki uski family ne use apna liya.
It is incredible. Something that is totally lacking in most of the world, to be honest	Haan, incredible hai.  Sach kahoon to yeh baat duniya bhar mein totally lacking hai.
which is why they had to make a movie about it :)	Isi karan unko iske baare movie banana pada.
Of course	Bilkul.
I would be curious to know where Mike is today	Main yeh pata lagane ke liye curious hoon ki aajkal Mike kahan hai?
He is still in the NFL, I believe	Mera vishwas hai ki woh ab bhi NFL mein hai.
I am not as sure as to what team he plays for, but I am relatively sure that he is still playing	Mujhe nahin jaanta ki woh kis team ke liye khelta hai, but main relatively sure hoon ke woh ab bhi khelta hai.
I didn't remember that Tim McGraw was the dad. He's the big country singer right?	Mujhe yaad nahin tha ki Tim McGraw hi dad hai.  Woh ek bada country singer hai, theek hai na?
He is. I do not remember him much from the movie, which may or may not be a bad thing	Haan hai.  Mujhe movie se uske baare mein yaad nahin hai, jo achchi ya buri cheez ho sakti hai.

It does sound pretty interesting and I can see the reviews are pretty high	ye tho pretty interest lag raha hi aour mene dekha hi ki riviews tho pretty jyada hi.
I personally have watched this movie. I thought it was super cute and it can be related to general life.	mene khood dekha ye movie. me ne socha hi ki , ye tho bahut cute aour ye tho relate to general life.
are you familiar with any of the actors?	aap pi chanta hi kya koyi actors ko?
Yes the short reviews at the bottom suggest it is thought provoking. 	ha, ye neeche chota reviews hi na , vo tho thoda sochne ka hi.
I can't say for sure but gennifer Goodwin sounds familiar	me ne nahi bhol sakta hi surely, but gennifer goodwin tho bahut familiar hi.
Have you seen any other movies from the director? 	aap koyi movies dekha hi kya ye director ka?
Honestly, when I watch movies, I hardly ever pay attention to who made it. 	saccha yi se , jab mi ne dekte hu movies ko, mi ne utna attention nahi rakta hu, ye koun banaya hi.
have you?	aap kuch?
Nope. I am a sucker for movies with animated animals though so I will definitely have to check this out. 	nahi. muje toh animated animal movies koh pasand hein toh mein jarur usse check karunga
Yea, Judy Hopps is the main character and is considered the first ever bunny cop. Sounds funny. 	yea, judy hopps toh main character hein, aur voh toh pehla bunny cop hein. badi funny laga
Agreed. There's a comment at the bottom about species stereotypes which sounds interesting too	maantha hoon. kuch species stereotype ka comment bottom mein hein bahut interesting laga
But they thought she would be able to handle being a cop  because shes a bunny.	lakin sab sochthe the ki yek bunny kaise cop bana aur voh kaise handle kar paathe
Most of the cop or police are normally these big animals.	kahi cop yar police toh badi badi animals hi role play karte.
Yep. Which to me is a bit counterintuitive because you think of rabbits being a prey species so more likely to run away from trouble. 	haan. muje bhi thoda counterintuitive laga kyon ki rabbit toh yek prey species hein aur voh toh trouble mein run karna hi pasand karega
Exactly.	bilkul
Of course the fox has to be the bad guy	haan aur fox toh bad guy hein
Actually, he is displayed as the slick fox. Always trying to con his way in to something.	actually, voh toh alick fox ko dekhayi gaya hein... kabhi bhi voh usko ache ke taraf hi le ja raha tha
But he turns out to be a good guy. 	lakin voh toh good guy nikhla
I'm trying to figure out who otterton and Manchas are from the new paragraph that flashed up	mai figure out karne ki koshish kar raha ahi ki otterton aur Manchas kya new paragraph se flash up hue hai

Key scene two shows rabbit and fox working together! 	key scene me rabbit aur fox dono ko together working karte dikhaya hai
Otterton is a missing person that judy is trying to find	otterton ek missing person hai jise judy dhundhne ki koshish kar rahi hai
Judy kind of blackmailed Nick(fox) in working with her.	Judy ne lagbhag Nick(fox) ko blackmai kiya uske sath work karne ke liye
I see. It sounds like a movie that has a well developed story line	I see, yah to us movie ki tarah sound kar raha hai jiska ek well developed story line hai
It was a very good kids movie.	yah kids ki lye badhiya movie thi
I'm just shocked that it wasn't as big as the Disney movies	mujhe ye dekh ke shock laga kiy Disney movies ki tarah badi nahi hai
Oh ok. I'm a little bit wary of rotten tomato ratings also	Oh ok, mai bhi rotten tomato ki rating ko lekar dukhi rahta hu.
They can sometimes stray quite far from the other review sites of a bunch of very keen reviewers want to bump the score	kabhi kabhi wo dusri review sites se jo kuch keen reveiwers ke dwara hoti hai kafi bhatak jate hai
Ok scene three has some drug manufacturing going on! 	Ok scene three me kuch drug manufacturing ho rahi hai.
Yes, the drugs make the animals revert to their natural state.	Yes, drugs animals ko wapas unki natural state me le aati hai.
Oh so there must be some other force making them break moulds	oh wanha par kuch dusra force bhi hona chahiye unko break moulds banane ke liye.
They become crazy animals again	Wo fir se crazy animals ban gaye.
But this is all while they still think Judy is a small cop	but ye sab tab bhi hai jab unhe laga thai ki Judy small cop hai
so they still dont consider her a strong animal	so wo abhi bhi use strong animal nahi consider karte.
I see. Interesting. Hope she gets more respect later with all the arrests	I see, Interesting. Hope baki arrests ke baad use or jyada respect mile
yea she does	Yea usne kar dikhaya

Amazing	amazing yar

really? I thought they were making all sorts of remakes 	vaastav mein? mujhe laga ki ve har tarah ke reemek bana rahe hain
I did not here about that and also  scene on the beach was very scarey	main yahaan us baare mein nahin tha aur samudr tat par bhee drshy bahut daraavana tha
for me when the guys were trapped on the boat was what I found most scary 	mere lie jab naav par log phanse the mujhe vahee sabase daraavana laga

surprised how they needed a professional to catch the shark	aashchary hai ki shaark ko pakadane ke lie unhen ek peshevar kee aavashyakata kaise huee

Yes sure..Its really big deal on Chris hemsworth	haan sure, Chris Hemworth k liye big deal hai.
i also think this movie has kind of served as a template for newer super hero movies	Mujhe ye bhi lagta hai is movie ne new super hero movies k liye ek template jaise serve kiya hai.
the all star cast really helped too 	All star cast ne bhi help ki hai
not sure you could do a movie better than this one for this style	main sure nahi hu  is style k liye koi  iss movie se better kar sakta hai.
Yeah..but previous super hero acting is very well and adorable..	haan..lekin pichhale supar heero ka abhinay bahut achchha aur manamohak hai ..
well all depends on the movie	achchhee tarah se sabhee philm par nirbhar karata hai
this movie also may have done the best job out there on getting the hulk right	ho sakata hai ki is philm ne bhee halk ko sahee kaam karane mein behatar kaam kiya ho
Yes..Hulk act is marvelous in this movie	haan..hulk act is philm mein adbhut hai
it also does a nice job of making iron man a leader	yah lohe ke aadamee ko neta banaane ka achchha kaam bhee karata hai

Yes..Its all super heroes action equally displayed	haan..yadi sabhee supar heero ekshan samaan roop se pradarshit hote hain

i feel like this is kind of the super hero movie that does it all right	mujhe aisa lagata hai ki yah ek tarah kee supar heero philm hai jo ise theek karatee hai
Yes.. really 	haan sach
hopefully they keep getting it right	Ummeed karta hun ki they keep getting it right
Yeah..when you watch this movie??	Yeah ... tumne kab dekhi ye movie??
What do you think of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?	Gal gadot ek wonder woman he kya sochte ho?
I do too	mai bhi karta hu
I was very impressed with both of them, what about Frozen?	mai dono se bahut impress hua, aur Frozen ke baare me?
I thought they actually did a very good job bringing the story to life in a different way	actually mujhe lagta haiki unhone life ki story ko ek different way me lake bahut badhiya job kiya hai
Yeah I couldn't agree more with you. 	Yes mai tumse is jyada agree nahi ho sakta
Did you have any favorite parts? Characters?	tumhara koi favorite part? Characters?
Disney does a impressive job with animated movies. 	animated movies ke saath Disney ka job bahut impressive hai.
They really do. Its amazing how much detail they put into them.	wo really karte hai. itni saari details usme dena bahut amazing hai.
Jonathan Gross as  Kristoff was my favorite character. 	Jonathan Gross ka Kristoff ka character mera favorite hai.
how about yours?	tumhare bare me kya?
Even though he didn't have a voice I liked Sven. I love how Disney always puts in non talking characters in their films that help move the story along	Even thoough Sven ki voice nahi thi par mujhe pasand hai. mujhe achcha lagta hai, Disney kaise bina voice ke character ko film me lekar bhi kahani move karta hai.
Yeah its impressive how they can give a character lots of personality without even having a voice.	haan isake prabhaavashaalee ve kaise ek aavaaj ke bina bhee ek vyaktitv ke bahut saare charitr de sakate hain.
I can only wish I was that talented as an artist. I am more the stick figure type of artist	main keval yah chaah sakata hoon ki main ek kalaakaar ke roop mein pratibhaashaalee hoon. main kalaakaar ka stik phigar adhik hoon
Thats about as much talent as I have when it comes to art as well haha. 	mere paas jitanee pratibha hai utanee hee kala ke baare mein bhee hai.
My kids laugh at me all the time about it	mere bachche mere baare mein har samay hansate rahate hain
From what I'm reading they created a Frozen Broadway show. That would be great to take your kids to!	main jo padh raha hoon usase unhonne phrojan brodave sho banaaya. yah aapake bachchon ko lene ke lie bahut achchha hoga!
Hello, are you there?	namaste kya aap vahaan hain?
yes	haan
is this the same person ive been talking to?	kya yah vahee vyakti hai jo baat kar raha hai?
Are you still around?	kya aap abhee bhee aasapaas hain?
yep still here	abhee bhee yahaan haan
did you get the new document	kya aapako naya dastaavez mila hai
I would be curious to see if htey come out with another frozen	mujhe yah dekhane ke lie utsuk hona chaahie ki kya hetee ek aur jame hue ke saath baahar aate hain
usually sequels can be disappointing but that doesn't seem to be the case with animated movies. 	aamataur par seekval niraashaajanak ho sakate hain lekin yah enimeted philmon ke maamale mein nahin lagata hai.
I think it could be really successful, especially as there has been a good break in time since the first one came out	mujhe lagata hai ki yah vaastav mein saphal ho sakata hai, khaasakar jab se pahalee baar baahar aane se samay mein ek achchha brek aaya hai
It is interesting that Disney was able to add onto the history of works such as Beauty and the beast	yah dilachasp hai ki dijnee saundary aur jaanavar jaise kaaryon ke itihaas mein jodane mein saksham tha
Hello	hello
Hello	hello
Have you seen the movie Frozen?	kya aapane philm phrojan dekhee hai?
Yes I have, I actually saw it in theatres with my Fiance at the time it came out.	haan mere paas hai, main vaastav mein ise apane mangetar ke saath sinemaagharon mein dekha tha jab yah baahar aaya tha.
Did you like it?	kya aapako yah pasand aaya?
Yes, it is a funny animation film.	jee haan, yah ek phanee enimeshan philm hai.
I agree. I saw it in theaters too	main sahamat hoon. mainne ise sinemaagharon mein bhee dekha
I enjoy almost anything that Disney produces	mujhe lagabhag kuchh bhee pasand hai jo dijnee paida karata hai
The critical response was pretty good I see. \	aalochanaatmak pratikriya mujhe bahut achchhee lagee. \
I heard they are making a second movie to follow Frozen	mainne suna ki ve phrojan pholo karane ke lie doosaree philm bana rahe hain
It only got an 89 percent on rotten tomatoes. I thought it would get a higher score.	sade hue tamaataron par ise keval 89 pratishat mila. mainne socha tha ki yah ek uchch ank praapt karega.
I don't much care for review sites, I would rather watch a movie and judge it myself.	main saiton kee sameeksha karane ke lie bahut paravaah nahin karata, main ek philm dekhoonga aur ise khud jaj karoonga.
I agree with the CinemaScore of A+	mein maantha hoon ki us cinema ka score A+ hein
Me too, I love the artwork and time that goes into animation and C.G. movies	mein bhi, muje voh artwork aur uska timing animation aur CG work ka movies bahut pasand hein
It seems like this movie just came out. I cannot believe it was 2013 when it arrived in theaters. 	lagtha hein ki, abhi hi us movie ko release huva. muje yakin hi nahi hota ki voh 2013 mein aaya hoga jab theaters mein
Yeah, so much attention and popularity has kept it alive in stores as toys, shows and other items.	haan yar, jyada attention aur populatity us stores ke toys, shows aur jyada items mein ab tak jinda rakh rahe hein
Who is your favorite character in Frozen?	frozen mein aapka favorite character kon hein
It either has to be Sven or Christophe	muje toh sven ya christophe pasand hein
Kristoff*	kristoff???
Do you know who Kristen Bell is?	aapko kristen bell patha nahi hein kya?
I know of her, but not familiar of her other acting jobs.	patha hein, lekin jyada familiar nahi hein jaise other acting jobs ke swar
I like the villain. I thought he was funny.	muje toh voh villain pasand hein, voh jyada funny lag rahe the
Yeah, something was up when they fell for each other early in the movie between him and Anna	Yeah,uske aur anna ke bich movie se pehle kuch hua
Olaf could be a bit much sometimes, but had some funny parts	Olaf thoda aur hona chahiye,par thoda funny part bhi
Yeah, I did not even guess he would have been a bad guy	Yeah,mene socha nahi tha wo bad ladka hoga
I think I called it during the movie and said something to my fiance about how redheads are always portrayed as badguys.	Mene socha mene use movie ke dauran bulaya and finance ke bare me kuch kaha kaise redheads are always portrayes as badguys
Good point. I didn't even think of that	Achha point.mene socha bhi nahi tha
He looks like the villian commander from the newer Star Wars movies.	Naye star wars movie me wo villian commander ke jesa dikh raha tha
What rating would you give the movie out of ten?	Das me se kitne rating donge movie ko
I think an 9, it was a great movie, even if the music is overplayed	Nine ,accha movie tha music jyada play hone ke bad bhi
Bye!	Aavjo
What is your opinion on the movie Jaws? 	philm joz par aapakee kya raay hai?
To be honest, I find shark movies to be terrifying.	sach kahoon, to mujhe shaark philmen bhayaanak lagatee hain.
I can't say I blame you. The movie definitely makes that fear worse! 	main yah nahin kah sakata ki main tumhen dosh deta hoon. philm nishchit roop se us dar ko badatar bana detee hai!
Did you know that this film was based on a book?	Kya tumhe pata hai ki ye film ek book par based hai.
No, I didn't. Not surprised though. Most movies tend to be. 	Nahi , maine nahi. Lekin mein surprise nahi hun zyadatar movies mein aisa hi hota hai.
I do love the Jaws music though. 	Lekin Jaws ka music mujhe pasand hai.
Agreed, it heightens the tension and makes it scarier, but that's kind of the point.	Agreed, ye tension ko badhata hai aur isko aur daravana banata hai, lekin shayad uska wahi point hai.
Are you surprised at how high the rating is for the film's critic score? And if I heard the music while driving, I would think someone was coming to take me out. Haha	Kya aap surprised hain ki is film ki critic score rating itni high hai ? Aur agar mein iska music driving karte samay sunoon to mujhe lagega ki koi mujhe maarne aa raha hai. Haha
97% is incredibly high, I would have thought that there would be at least some people throwing low scores in there somewhere.	97% bahut zyada high hai , mujhe laga ki kam se kam kuch log to low scores denge.
Do you agree that it's a "cheerfully perverse" scare movie?	Kya aap sehmat hai ki ye "cheerfully perverse" daravani movie hai ?
That's what I thought as well. Maybe it's because it was never done before in it's time and was so different when it came out? It might be easier to "give it a pass"   And I would say it could be "cheerfully perverse" depending on the kind of movies you enjoy. 	Mujhe bhi aisa hi lagta hai. Shayad isliye kyunki us zamane mein aisa pehle nahi hua tha aur jo nikal ke aaya wo kafi alag tha ? Usko ""give it a pass" dena easier hoga aur mein kahunga ki ye "cheerfully perverse" depending on aap kaisi movies pasand karte hain.
Do you think that it "is too gruesome for children"? 	Kya aapko lagta hai ki it "is too gruesome for children"?
For small children, yes. I could see them having nightmares.	Chhote bacchon ke liye haan, unko nightmares aa sakte hain.
I definitely agree with that. I do find it odd that it is considered a "Thriller" film. 	main definitely isase agree karta hoon. Mujhe yah ajeeb lagata hai ki ise ek "Thriller" film maana jaata hai.
I think it's interesting that in the key scenes it describes the economic impact on a beach town of the shark attacks. Makes you wonder if they'd cover something like that up to make more money in real life.	mujhe lagata hai ki yah interesting hai ki key scenes mein yah  shark attacks ke ek beach town pareconomic impact ka baare main batata hai. Aapako aashchary hota hai ki kya ve real life mein adhik paisa banaane ke lie aisa kuchh cover karenge.
In today's society, I think that would absolutely be the case. Even if there was a bounty hunter hired, they would probably go, "Nothing to see here, have fun!" 	aaj ke society mein, mujhe lagata hai ki aisa hee hoga. yahaan tak ​​ki agar ek bounty hunter ko kaam par rakha gaya tha, to ve shaayad bolengain, "yahaan dekhane ke lie kuchh bhee nahin hai, maze karo!"
I find it interesting that they put it in a fictional "New England resort town". You would think they would've picked somewhere in California since there's so many beaches and how huge it is. 	mujhe yah interesting lagata hai ki unhonne ise fictional  "New England resort town" mein rakha tha. Aapako lagata hai ki ve Californiamein kaheen aur le gae hote kyonki vahaan bahut saare beaches hain aur yah kitana vishaal hai.
Agreed, there typically aren't many shark attacks in New England, usually further south or on the west coast.	Main ye maanta hoon ki , aamataur par  New England mein bahut saare shark attacks nahin hote hain, aamataur par south mein ya west coast par.
I can't imagine I would keep going to the beach as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead.	main imagine nahin kar sakata ki main ek tourist ke roop mein  beacht par jata rahoongan , agar bahut saare log marate hue paaye jate rahein.
I agree. The movie is kind of silly the more you think about it. Especially when people keep believing the town and beach team that everything is fine. Yet people keep dying? I guess they want you to suspend disbelief. Haha. 	Main agree karta hoon. Movie ek tarah se silly hai , jitana bhi aap isake baare mein sochate hain. khaasakar jab log shahar aur beach team par vishvaas karate rahate ki sab kuchh theek hai.phir bhee log marate rahate hain? mujhe lagata hai ki ve chaahate hain ki aap disbelief ko suspend karen. hah।
Or you would think that tourists would join in on the bounty to make the money. 	ya aapako lagata hai ki tourists paisa banaane ke lie bounty mein shaamil honge.
I wasn't aware that there were so many different types of sharks so near to the shore. 	mujhe pata nahin tha ki kinaare ke paas itane saare different type ke sharks the.
The key scens describes both a tiger shark and a great white.	key scenes main tiger shark aur ek great white, donon ka varnan kiya gaya hai.
I wonder if the mayor is paid off somewhere in the town or gets a cut of the beaches being open? He's far to adamant about keeping them open.   And I always thought Tiger Sharks were smaller. 	Main soch raha tha ki mayor sheher mein kahin paise leta hai ya beach ke khulne pe? Woh beach kholne par bohot adamant tha. Aur mujhe humesha lagta tha ki Tiger Sharks chotti hoti hain.
I always think of Great White's as the huge "Jaws" sharks. 	Maine Great Whites ko humesha unn badi "Jaws" sharks ki tarah socha hai.
It seems odd that they don't ask a scientist or marine biologist at some point to intervene.	Ajeeb hai ki woh kissi scientist ya marine biologist ko beech mein nahi laa rahe.
Even the last key scene describes a pretty limited plan to hook the shark or harpoon it.	Last scene mein bhi bohot hi limited plan hai shark ko hook ya harpoon karne ka.
I agree. They have an "Oceanographer" to help determine a shark attack. But no scientists ever get brought in to help the situation. 	Sahi, I agree. Unke paas shark attack determine karne ke liye ek "Oceanographer" hai. Par koi scientists nahi laaye help karne ke liye.
It seems like a pretty poor plan, and they end up having to make it up as they go along. 	Kaafi bekar plan hai, aur aage jaate jaate woh plan banaate jaa rahe hain.
It seems crazy that a shark could take out a "Shark-proof" cage. 	Kitna crazy hai ki shark ne "shark-proof" cage todd diya.
Plus, the reward of only $10,000 seems pretty low to risk lives.	Aur, $10,000 ka reward bohot kam hai life risk karne ke liye.
Maybe it was worth a lot more in 1975?	Shayad 1975 mein isse zyaada worth tha.
I agree. Not worth it to me. I'll go on vacation in NYC instead and avoid the shark. Haha. 	Haan. Mere liye toh worth nahi hai. Shark ko chhod ke, main NYC vacation par chala jaoonga. Haha.
And it was definitely worth more in 1975. I just don't know how much. 	Aur yeh 1975 Definitely adhik kimat ka hoga.me nahi janti how much.
What did you think of Gal Gadots portrayal of Wonder Woman? 	wonder woman mei gal gadots portrayal ke bare mei kya khayal hai?
I thought she did a great job.	mere khayal se usne bahut achcha kaam kiya.
What did you thinK?	tumhara kya khayal hai?
I agree! Loved it. 	mei sahmat hui payaar se.
I thought she was a great choice.	mujhe lagata hai ki ye bahut achchi pasad thi .
Me too!	mei bhi
She was unknown to me before.	ye pahale mujhse anjaan thi.
Do you know if she was in anything before Wonder Woman?	kya aap iske baare mei janate hai wonder woman ke pahale?
So, what else did you like?	to, aapako aur kya pasand aaya?
I didn't know Billy Crystal was the voice of Mike but I love it!	mujhe nahi mahum thai ki Billy Crystal Mike ki voice the but achcha tha!
Steve  Buscemi is in this too?	Steve Buscemi bhi isme hai?
Yes he is! I'm guessing you've seen Monsters University?	haa vo hai! Mene shoch ki tumne Monsters University dekha hai?
I did when it came out years ago, just never thought to look at the voice acting.	mene kiya jab ye kuch saal pahale aa gai thi, mene nahi socha tha ki voice acting hogi.
When did you see it?	tumne kab dekha?
Hello, how are 	Hello, kaise he
you doing?	aap kar rahe hai?
Hi!  I'm doing well, thanks!	hi! main accha kar raha hun, thanks!
So, what did you think of the blind side?	so, aapne blind side ke baare me kya socha?
I love sports documentaries, so I favored this movie. H ow about you?	mujhe sports documentaries pasand hai, So main in movies ka favor karta hun, Aapka baare me kya hai?
It was quite good.  I'm not surprised it got such good reviews on Cinemascore	Ye quite good tha. Main surprised nahi hun ki ise cinemascore me itne acche reviews mile
Same here. It is a little odd that it got lower reviews on other platforms like Metacritic. I take it you like sports docs too?	Same here. Ye little odd hai ki ise dusre platforms par lower reviews mile jaise ki Metacritic. Main apko sports docs ki tarah leta hun?
Yes, very much.  It's surprising how much adversity Oher had to overcome, don't you think?	Yes, bahut had tak. Main surprise hun ki kitne adversity Oher ko kam karni padegi, aapko nahi lagta?
Yeah, It must've been really difficult on him. I wonder how he felt having to relive his experience through the movie. I don't know how I would handle it. 	Yeah, ye nischit hi unhe liye kafi difficult hoga. I wonder kaise unhone is movie ke dwara apne experience ko relive karna mahsoos kiya hoga. Main nahi jaanta ki main ise kaise handle karuga.
Did you like Sandra Bullock in the movie?	kya tumhe Sandra Bullock is movie me pasand aayi?
Yeah, Bullock was great.  Although, she's a great actor so I think she does well in most of her roles	Hann, Bullock great thi.  Waise bhi, woh great actor hai and zyadatar roles mein achcha hi karti hai.
Totally agree. Easy to see why the critics applauded her performance	Main totally manta hoon.  Easily dikhta hai critics kyon use performance ko applaud karte hain.
Any thoughts on any of the other actors? I had forgotten Tim McGraw was in the movie, haha	Doosre actors ke baare mein kya thoughts hain?  Main bhook gaya tha ki Tim McGraw bhi movie mein tha, haha.
I thought Quinton Aaron was very good, too.  	Mujhe laga Quinton Aaron bhi bahut achcha tha.
It must have been tough to go through foster care so much, but I think it's good that Oher found something to latch on to in football.	Foster care se guzarna bahut mushkil hua hoga, par achchi baat hai football mein Oher ko naya sahara mila.
Yeah, he certainly excelled in it. I think he was able to apply his protective qualities in his personality to football	Haan, usne bahut hi achcha pradarshan kiya.  Mujhe lagta hai usne apne personality ke protective qualities to football mein dikhaya.
Definitely.  He was also very lucky to finally find a good foster family.  It's super difficult to find a good family that cares about their foster kids.	Bilkul.  Woh bahut lucky tha ki use achcha foster family mil gayi.  Ek achche family ka milna bahut mushkil hai jo apne foster kids ka care karti hai.
Yeah, I would imagine that it's hard. I feel like that's why it was such agood movie. Nothing seemed to be all that good in his life until he found a family that would treat him like one of their own	Haan, yeh kitna hard hai, main samaj sakta hoon.  Mujhe lagta hai yeh movie isi liye itna achcha laga.  Uski zindagi mein kuch bhi achcha nahin tha jab tak us family ko usne dekha jo use apna samajte the,
What do you think of the idea of "protective instincts" and how it influenced Oher's behavior?	Tumhe  "protective instincts" idea kaise lagta hai aur is idea ne Oher ke behavior ko kaise influence kiya?
I remember he ranked very high when he was taking his career test. It definitely translated well into his efforts in football. Do you think that helped his family as well?	Mujhe yaad hai uska rank bahut achcha tha jab woh career test le raha tha.  Yeh rank use football mein achche efforts dalne me kaam aya.  Kya tumhe lagta hai ki is se uski family ko bhi help mili?
I'm sure it did.  It's ironic, though, that he has such strong protective instincts when he was abandoned by his mother. Do you think he was overcompensating?	Main sure hoon aisa hi hua.  Magar, usme itna stron protective instincts hain jabki usi maa ne use abandon kar diya tha.  Kya tumhe lagta hai ki woh overcompensate kar raha tha?
How did you feel about the scene where Collins adopts Oher?	Tumhe woh scene kaise laga jahan Collins Oher ko adopt karta hai?
As for being overcompensating, that he was not. I think that was built naturally in him, where he was not consciously  trying to do it.	Mujhe nahin lagta ki woh overcompensate kar raha tha.  Mujhe lagta hai yeh usme naturally built hai aur woh consciously karne ki koshish nahin kar raha tha.
How did you feel about the scene where Collins adopts Oher?	Tumhe woh scene kaise laga jahan Collins Oher ko adopt karta hai?
I think LeighAnne's friends were concerned that Collins would not be safe around him.	Mujhe lagta hai  LeighAnne ke friends concerned the ki Collins uske paas safe nahin rah paayega.
I think that was probably a tough choice for the family to make as a whole.	Mujhe lagta hai as a whole, woh shayad family ke liye ek tough choice tha.
Do you think going to Ole Miss was a good decision?	Kya tumhe lagta hai ki Ole Miss jaana ek achcha decision tha?
Yeah in the long run, he felt like he had family there. Do you think that he meant his mother at all in that choice?	Haan, anth mein, use laga ki uski family wahan thi. Kya tumhe lagta hai ki uski choice mein uski mother bhi shaamil thi?
Probably not because she was a drug addict.  I think he was referring to his adopted family.	Nahin ho sakta kyonki woh ek drug addict thi. Mujhe lagta hai woh apni adopted family ke baare mein bata raha tha.
How do you think the gang leader in his old town affected him?	Tumhe kya lagta hai ki uske old town ke gang leader ka uspar kya asar hua?
I think that was what grew his protective instincts even more. He was worried what might happen to his adoptive family when Leigh Anne and Collins were threatened by the gang leader. 	mujhe lagta hai usse hi uske protective instinct aur grow kar gaye. Jab gang leader ne Leigh Anne aur Collins ko dhamkaya to wo chinta me tha k uske adoptive family ko kya hoga
Do you think he made the right decision to fight back?	Kya tumhe lagta hai uska fight back karne ka decision sahi tha?
Yeah, definitely, you have to protect yourself!	Haan, definitely, tumhe khud ko to bachana hi hoga
Absolutely, I think he felt more of a connection with his adoptive family than with his own!	Absolutely, mujhe lagta hai uska apni khudki family se jyada adoptive family se connection hai.
Definitely, and who wouldn't.  I don't understand why people are so connected to their blood relatives if they weren't around to be part of their family	Definitely, kiska nahi hoga. Mujhe ye nahi samjh me aata log apne blood relative se itna connected kyu rahte hai bhale he wo family ka part banne k liye paas me nahi the
Yep. It seems like the Tuohy family accepted him and made him feel like he belonged there with him.	Haan, aisa lagta hai ki Tuohy family ne use accept kiya aur aisa feel karwa k jaise wo unke saaath hi belong karta hai
Good conversation, thanks for chatting!	Accha conversation, chat karne k liye thanks
hi	hi
see any good movies lately?	kya ache movies hein kya?
hello?	hello?
Hey! Not really, I just Batman vs. Superman. The 27% Rotten Tomatoes score is fitting.	Arre! sahi mein, main sirf Batman vs. Superman. 27% Rotten Tomatoes bilkul sahi hai.
oh, i havent seen that one, tell me more	oh, maine yeh ek nhi dekha, mujhe aur batao
why was it so bad?	ye itna bura kyun tha?
Well, it's the sequel to Man of Steel. There's a lot of meaningless action and not much else.	Khair, ye Man of Steel ki agli kadi hai. Ismein bahut sa bewajah action aur iske ilawa kuch nhi hai.
Hello.	hello, Namaste.
Hi, have you seen the John Wick movies?	Namaskar, kya tumne John Wick movies watch ki?
I have seen the first one but I have not seen the second one.	mene first one dekhi but mene second one nahi dekhi.
The next one is great where he goes after his car that was stolen.	Next one great he, jahan voh apni stolen car ko search karne jata he.
That sounds interesting.  I will make plans to the see the 2nd John Wick movie.  What was the topic of the movie that you read about?	ye to interesting lagta he. me 2nd John Wick movie dekhne ka plan banaunga.Movie ka topic kya tha jiske bare me tumne read kiya tha.
He was seeking revenge for the theft of his car and the killing of his puppy.	voh toh apni car ka chori ko revenge karte karte usne puppy ko maar daali
What person was he seeking revenge against?	konsa person ko voh revenge lena chatha hein
Losef the son of the head of the Tarasov syndicate, took the Mustang to Aurello's shop to get the VIN number changed and Aurello kicks him out of the shop and tells John.	Losef us Tarasov ka head tha, usne Mustant ko Aurello ka shop Vin number change karne ko le chala aur Aurello john ko kick maara
How did John go about getting his revenge?	kaise john ko patha chala ki koi use revenge lena chatha hein?
John wanted to retire but was drawn back in to get revenge.	John toh retire hona chatha tha lakin usse revenge ho gaya
Does John get any help getting his revenge?	kya john ko koi madad kiya ki revenge se bachane ke liye?
John visited Aurello who tells him Losef  is the son of  Viggo.	john, aurello se mila aur losef ke baare mein bathaya
Who is Viggo?	viggo kon hein
 John learns that Losef is at the Night club from Winston of the Continental, he prepares to get Losef. He is the son of Viggo who is the head of the Russian syndicate in New York.	john sikha ki losef yek night club mein hein aur voh use pakadna chatha hein. voh viggo ka betha hein jo russian syndicate newyork mein hein uska head hein
Why doesn't Viggo just give Losef to John?	kyon viggo, john ko losef ko nahi deya?
John travels to little Russia where Viggo has a church front. He destroys the cache of money and blackmail making material,	John little Russia jaata hai jahan Viggo ke paas church front hai. Wahan par wo money ka cache aur blackmail banane wala samaan destroy kar deta hai.
Losef is his son and does not want Jon to kill him.	Losef uska son hau aur wo nahi chahta Jon usey maare
Why doesn't Viggo just pay for John's new car and buy him a new dog to save his son?	Viggo ne John ki new car ke liye kyun pay nahi kia aur usey apne bete ko save karne ke liye naya dog kyun nahi buy kia?
They tried to kill John so he was after the whole sindicate and raced to the Helicopter that Viggo was trying to escape in.	Unhone John ko maarne ki try ki so wo whole syndicate ke peeche tha aur jis Helicopter mein Viggo escape karne ki try kar raha tha uski taraf bhaaga.
I think this is the one you saw.	I think ye wala tumne dekha
I don't remember much of the plot from the first movie.  I do remember John Wick  killing everyone in bullet filled ballet.	Mujhe first movie ke baare mein zyada yaad nahi. Mujhe ye yaad hai ki John Wick ne bullet filled ballet mein sabko maara.
I loved the end where he takes out Viggo being stabbed. He then goes to a Veterinarian and treats his self and takes a pit bull puppy scheduled to be euthanized.  	Mujhe end bahut acha laga jahan usne Viggo ko stab kia. Fir wo veterinarian ke paas gaya aur khud ko treat kiya aur pit bull puppy ko liya jo euthanize hone ke liye scheduled tha.
I do remember that part.  I enjoyed the ending of the movie.	Mujhe wo part yaad hau. Main movie ki ending enjoy ki.
The part where he walks home along the boardwalk with the puppy and rembers that is where he had his last date with Helen.	Wo part jab wo ghar walk karta hau along boardwalk puppy ke saath aur yaad karta hai ki Helen ke saath uski last date yahan thi.
Who is Helen?	Helen kon hai?
She was his wife that died.	She was his wife joh mar gayee
How did she die?	Uski kaisse death huyee

Hi! So what did you think of the 1990 comedy Home Alone?	Hi! Apko 1990 ki comedy Home Alone kaisi lagi?
Hello. I like it. It's very interesting and hilarious to me seeing Joe Pesci in a movie like this since I know him form the more serious movies he did.	Hello. Mujhe acchi lagi. Mujhe Joe Pesci ko aisi interesting aur hilarious movie me dekh ke accha laga kyuki maine unhe jyadatar serious movies me hi dekha hai.
Very true! He nailed the role of Harry! All of the actors did! Was he your favorite actor in the film?	Sahi kha! Usne Harry ka role bohot accha nibhaya. Sabhi actors ne accha kam kiya! Kya wah apke favorite the film me?
Macaulay Culkin is my favorite in the movie. It was so fun just watching him outsmart 2 grown men.	Is movie me Macaulay Culkin mere favorite the. Unko 2 adults ko outsmart karte dekh bahut maza aaya.
Agreed! He was my favorite as well! I can't help but agree with CinemaScore's rating of A as that would be the rating I'd give the film as well!	Agreed! Vah mere bhi favorite the! CinemaScore ke rating A se main bilkul agree karta hu, mai bhi is film ko yahi ratings dunga.
Yes this is a christmas classic and deserves an A rating. I feel the critic that described the movie as having an implausible plot is taking the movie more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be.	Yes, yah ek christmas classic hai aur A rating ke layak hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki jo critics is movie ko iske implausible plot ke liye criticize karte hai woh is movie ko kuchh jyada hi seriously le rahe hai, creators ka irada serious movie banane ka nahi tha.
Very well said! Some of the critics were out of their minds. Especially the one you described as well as the one who called the first half "flat and unsurprising".	Sahi kaha! Kuchh critics pagal ho gaye hain. Khash kar woh jiska apne description diya aur woh jisne first half ko "flat aur unsurprising" bataya.
Yes I found the first half very entertaining. I haven't seen this movie in a little wow I might go back and watch it	Han, muje first half bada entertaining laga. Maine ye movie little wow me nahi dekhi, main shayad jaunga aur dekhunga.
I feel you! So hard to believe it was released in 1990! 	Main apko feel kar sakta hu. Yakin nahin hota ki yeh movie 1990 me release huyi thi.
I like the quote "sadistic festival of adult-bashing". Between's Kevin's parents forgetting him and the burglars this movie doesn't make adult looks too bright.	Mujhe  "sadistic festival of adult-bashing" yah quote achha lagta hai. Kevin ke parents ka use bhulna aur burglars ke bich yah movie adults ko bahut accha nahi deikhati.
That is true! Ha! Pesci and Stern did a great job acting the part as adults who weren't very bright! John Hughes wrote the movie perfectly!	yeh tho sach hein! ha! Pesci aur Stern tho acting ka badiya job kiya voh tho adults ka part bhi kiya jo itna bhi bright nahi tha! john Hughes ne is movie ko perfectly write kiya hein
I related to the character Kevin being made fun of  by his family since kids deal with that all the time. The part of the movie always always hits a soft spot for me.	mein tho us kevin character ko relate kar raha hun voh tho fun hein uska family aur kids tho ache tarah deal kar raha tha. is part ka movie tho hamesha soft spot mein hi hit hota.
Same here! I honestly felt bad for Kevin at first seeing as how he was ridiculed by his siblings/cousins before being left behind. Like you, i could relate as well to the ridicule aspect of it.	yaha bhi! muje honestly kevin ke liye bura laga kyon ki pehele baar use dekha tho ridiculed mein uska siblings yaani cousins tho uska picha chod diya. aapke tarah, tho mein us ridicule ka aspect se relate kar raha tha
I wonder what kind of job Kevin's dad worked that he could afford to fly that many people to Paris for christmas. I blame him for all of this!	muje tho acharya laga ki voh kevin ka dad se work kar raha hein aur voh fly karne ka afford nahi kar saka tho kaafi people paris jaathe christmas ke liye. mein tho usse hi blame karunga
That is true! And plus they housed the entire family the night before their departure.	voh tho sach hein! aur uska pura family tho us night mein departure ho gaye hein
How much of rush do you have to be in to forget a whole human being. I guess nobody in the McCallister family was an early bird either. Alarms didn't always exist.	pura human being ke liye kitna rush karenge. mein tho koi McCallister ka family bird hota tho mein guess nahi kiya.  alarms tho nahi exist hien
No kidding! I wonder that as well! Then they don't even realize he's missing until Kate discovered it during the middle of their flight. So awful!	are kidding mat karna! mein bhi yeh sab wonder kartha! jab tak koi realize nahi hote tab kate ko koi flight mein nahi hein kar ke. yeh tho awful hein
I couldn't imagine anything other than my child being in danger convincing me to hitch hike with a polka band. I found that part very funny.	muje tho imagine bhi nahi kar saktha ki yeh sab danger tha mera childhood mein lekin voh tho polka band se hitch hike huva. muje tho us part ko badi funny laga
Same here - and in a moving van at that. That was incredibly hilarious!	yahi bhi- aur voh moving van tho badiya thi. voh tho incredibly hilarious hein
Imagine going through the trouble of flying halfway across the world for a holiday and not even being able to enjoy your time on the trip. That wouldn't be good at all for me I would be so mad.	soch le agar yeh halfway flying mein troble hein aur jab voh holiday ke liye jaa raha hein lekin usko us time ko enjoy nahi kar saka. tho yeh sab ache nahi hein na yeh tho mad ke tarah hein
I know, right? At that point, I felt sorry for Kate as well. Then on top of that, you can only land a flight to Scranton and while there, all flights to Chicago were booked. Talk about stressful!	mujhe pata hai, right? Us point par mujhe Kate ke liye sorry feel huya. Aur uske top par, tum sirf Scranton ki flight land kar sakte ho aur jab tum wahan ho, Chicago ki sari flights book thi. Kitna stressful hai!
For sure very stressful. I wonder what the family was thinking back in Paris at the apartment of Kevin's Uncle.	Han sure very stressful. I wonder wo family Paris mein Kevin ke uncle ke apartment mein kya think kar rahi hogi.
Their vacation was certainly ruined while Kevin was in the process of rigging up their house with booby traps for Harry and Marv! That was a hilarious scene as well!	Unki vacation certainly ruin hogayi hogi jab Kevin unke house ko booby traps se rig karne ke process mein tha Harry aur Marv ke liye! Wo scene bhi hilarious tha
Kevin was a kid genius. Rigging up the house like mini macgyver. Of course seeing Marv and Harry get tricked was very funny. Thank god Marley got there before Kevin got hurt.	Kevin kid genius tha. mini macgyver ki tarah house ko rig karne mein. Ofcourse Marv aur Harry ko trick hote dekhna funny tha. Thank god Marley Kevin ke hurt hone se pehle wahan pahunch gaya.
You're right! Thankfully he did get there just in time and the cops came shortly after to arrest Harry and Marv!	Tum sahi ho! Thankfully wo wahan time par pahunch gaya aur cops thode time mein Harry aur Marv ko arrest karne aa gaye
I love seeing the whole family reunited at the end. Having Kevin realize he didn't want his family to go away was very touching.	Muje whole family ko last mein reunite hote dekhkar kafi accha laga. Kevin ka ye realize karna ki wo apni family ko door nahi jane dena chahta bohat touching tha.
It was - especially after he sees the family was still gone on Christmas day at first before Kate entered the house calling for him.	Han wo tha - especially jab wo dekhta hai ki uski family Christmas Day par abhi bhi gayi huyi hai Kate ke ghar mein enter karke bulane se pehle
I do find it a little interesting that no one informed the family about the events that took place while they were gone. I would figure the police might be interested to talk to Kevin's parents.	Mujhe ye interesting laga ki kisine family ko nahi inform kiya ki jab wo gaye they tab ghar mein kya events huye. Mujhe lagta hai police shayad Kevin ke parents se baat karne mein interested ho.
I agree but it was hilarious when Buzz yelled "Kevin what did you do to me room?" and Kevin ran off at the end. I enjoyed discussing Home Alone with you today!	I agree jab Buzz yell karta hai  "Kevin what did you do to me room?" wo bohat hilarious tha. Aur end me Kevin bhag jata hai. Mujhe aaj tumse Home Alone discuss karke kafi acha laga.

One of my favorite movies of all time	ye movie meri all time favorite me se ek he
Mine too! I still get nervous going into the ocean	meri bhi! me ab bhi ocean me jate samay nervous ho jati hoon.
So do I! It freaks me out, big time	so do i! ye mujhe pagal kar deta he, big time
I know.I think this was one of Speilbergs best films.	i know. mere vichar se ye Speilbergs ki best films me se ek he.
Most definitely 	bilkul definitely
I love all of them, so I can't say that I have a favorite	me un sab ko love karti hu, isliye me kisi ek ko apna favorite nahi kah sakti.
I love Richard Dreyfus and his Matt Hooper was fabulous. Did he get nominated or win an Oscar for that role?	mujhe Richard Dreyfus se pyar he aur uski Matt hooper fabulous thi. Kya use nomination mila ya us role ke liye usne Oscar jeeta
I'm not sure. If he didn't, he sure deserved it	me sure nahi hoon.Agar usne nahi jeeta to voh sure deserve karta he.
I find it interesting that Metacritics only had a score of 87/100 for Jaws. What were they using to measure this? Rotten Tomatoes gave it 97%	mujhe yeh interesting lagta he ki Metacritics ka Jaws ke liye score 87/100 tha.ve ise measure karne ke liye kya use kar rahe the?Rotten Tamataro ne ise 97% diye he.
I know, I don't get that either since it was the best in it's time and still is today, in my opinion.	mujhe pata hai, mujhe nahin lagata hai ki ya to yah us samay mein sabase achchha tha aur aaj bhee hai, meree raay mein
Agreed. I still like watching it when its on TV. I've been known to download it for a long flight too. The cast was outstanding and the music!!! Still gets me creeped out.	maana. main abhee bhee ise dekhana pasand karata hoon jab teevee par isakee. mujhe ise lambee udaan ke lie bhee daunalod karane ke lie jaana jaata hai. kaast bakaaya tha aur sangeet !!! abhee bhee mujhe baahar nikaal diya jaata hai.
Same here! My wife hates those movies and don't like to see them.	mujhe bhee! meree patnee un philmon se napharat karatee hai aur unhen dekhana pasand nahin karatee.
I don't know how she can hate it, but it's my favorite	mujhe nahin pata ki vah ise kaise napharat kar sakatee hai, lekin yah mera pasandeeda hai
I saw that the critics found it funny, in a weird sort of way. I think I kind of agree with that comment. There are moments that are funny, I can't say I agree with your wife, but it did scare some people too much. Maybe it scares her and thats why she hates it.	mainne dekha ki aalochakon ko yah ajeeb tarah se ajeeb laga. mujhe lagata hai ki main us tippanee se sahamat hoon. aise kshan hain jo majaakiya hain, main yah nahin kah sakata ki main aapakee patnee se sahamat hoon, lekin isane kuchh logon ko bahut dara diya. ho sakata hai ki vah use daraatee hai aur usase napharat karatee hai.
I kind of enjoyed the scary moments in it	mainne isamen daraavane palon ka aanand liya
It's so realistic and it could happen.	yah bahut yathaarthavaadee hai aur aisa ho sakata hai.
It does happen more than you think	yah aapake vichaar se adhik hota hai
It has happened! Thats whats so scary. Several attacks likek that off the east coast last summer.Felt like I was living Jaws! I stayed off the beach last summer!	ho chuka hai! kya itana daraavana hai. pichhalee garmiyon mein poorvee tat se door jaise kaee hamale hue the. main pichhalee garmiyon mein samudr tat se door raha!
So did I, it freaked me out too much	to kya mainne, isane mujhe bahut adhik prabhaavit kiya
In the film the found a tiger shark so they thought the beach was safe. Kind of like when we see a dolphin fin, scream, and then realize it was ok.The next day they see a great white in the same area of the beach. Jaws for real.	philm mein ek baagh shaark paaya gaya tha taaki unhen laga ki samudr tat surakshit hai. ek tarah se jab ham dolphin phin dekhate hain, chillaate hain, aur tab mahasoos hota hai ki yah theek hai. agale din ve samudr tat ke ek hee kshetr mein ek mahaan saphed dekhate hain. asalee ke lie jabade.
I know, one reason why I try and stay out of the oceans	mujhe pata hai, ek kaaran hai ki main koshish karata hoon aur mahaasaagaron se baahar rahata hoon
I know theres an alligator hunter that finds and removes those guys. In the movie they paid Quint, Richard Dreyfus to find the shark. Who would do that in real life? Not me!	mujhe pata hai ki ek magaramachchh shikaaree ko dhoondhata hai aur un logon ko nikaalata hai. shaark ko khojane ke lie philm mein unhonne kvint, richard drephas ko bhugataan kiya. asal jindagee mein kaun aisa karega? main nahin!
10K or not, I would not get in that water or that boat if a great white were out there	10k ya nahin, main us paanee ya us naav mein nahin jaata agar ek mahaan saphed vahaan se baahar hota
No way, I wouldn't either	koee raasta nahin, main bhee nahin hoga
Nope not at all	nahin bilkul nahin
sounds like you're pretty clever! Ironic they named the boat the Orca in the movie. Those Orcas are supposed to be pretty safe.	lagata hai ki tum bahut chaalaak ho! vidambana hai ki unhonne philm mein naav ka naam orka rakha hai. un orchas bahut surakshit maana jaata hai
Yeah, you know when you hear the music, look out	haan, aap jaanate hain ki jab aap sangeet sunate hain, to baahar dekhen
And can you imagine what it was like getting in a shark proof cage? I know someone who did that once. They said they'd never do it again!	aur kya aap kalpana kar sakate hain ki shaark prooph kej mein aisa kya tha? main kisee aise vyakti ko jaanata hoon jisane ek baar aisa kiya tha. unhonne kaha ki ve ise phir kabhee nahin karenge!
No way! I would have a heart attack	bilkul nahin! mujhe dil ka daura padega
Well, at least Jaws had a happy ending. Not for the shark though. The good old days when they made you feel good before you left the movie!	Jaws  film me khush anth hua. Lekin shark ke liye nahi. pahle dino jaise hame  movie dekar nikalne se pahle acha lagtha hai

the most 'realistic' take on batman yet	ab tak ki Batman par sabse 'realistic'
I'm actually interested in seeing it. Doesn't it have Christain Bale as Batman?	Main actually me interested hun ise dekhne me. kya isme Batman ke role me Christain Bale nahi hai?
yes	yes
It stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Morgan Freeman.	voh christian bale, michael caine, liam neeson, katie holmes, gary oldman, cillian murphy, tom wilkinson, rutger hauer, ken watanable aur morgan freeman ke sath start hota
great cast	badiya cast hein
Wow, even Morgan Freeman!? That is a good cast. Who does Freeman play?	acha tho morgan freeman bhi hein kya? voh badiya cast karte. tho freeman ka play kya hein?
He plays Lucious Fox. He's like Batman's Q (from 007)	voh lucious fox ke play kar rahe hein. usse batman ka q pasand hein
the tech guy who helps him out. So it's less of a one-man operation	us tech guy usse help kar raha tha. tho voh oneman operation se kam nahi lag raha tha
Yes, I remember the Character from the comics. That's awesome that they put him in the film. Does he play a big role? or is he just seen a little bit?	haan, muje us comic ka character thoda yaad hein. voh awesome hien, kya voh big role play kiya? ya kuch bit hi play kiya?
A fairly significant role. More-so in the sequels.	voh fairy significant role play kiya. tho jyada sequels tha.
Also stars Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, a devious villian and member of the League of Shadows	henri ducard jo liam neeson se shuru huva jo villian ka role play kiya jo league ka shadows ka member tha
That is really cool, normally they give those kinds of characters small roles.	voh cool hein yar. normally voh small role mein nahi aathe
The league of shadows is in the film!? Wait so that means Neeson is Ras Algul?	kya is film mein league ka shadows hein> wait yaani Neeson hi Ras algul hein?
Special guest appearance by Ken Watanabe as Ras Al Ghul	Ken Watanabe ne Ras Al Ghul ke kirdar me special guest appearance ki hai.
Do they mention his immortality in the film?	film me uski immortality ka mention kiya hai kya?
It's hinted at, but it's implied it's a mantle that's passed down for a more realistic take	iska hint to diya hai, par ye implie kiya gaya hai ki wo sirf mantle hai jo passed down hota, realistic karne ke liye

Ah so they stick to the comic closely, thats a good thing.	Oh to wo comics ke bahut close rahe, yah badi achchi baat hai.
Michael Caine must be Alfred. I can't see him playing anyone else.	Michael Caine jarur Alfred hoga. Mai use koi aur role play karte dekh hi nahi sakta.
Yes, origin-wise, it's pretty close. Bruce's traveling around the world and training is a part of it. Which has never been shown on screen before.	Yes, Origin-Wise, ye pretty close hai. Bruce around the world travel karta hai aur training iska part hai. Aisa kuc screen pahle kabhi nahi dikhaya gaya hai.
Yes he's an amazing Alfred	Yes, Wah amazing Alfred hai.

I can only imagine the sarcastic jokes he makes in the film. Caine is perfect for that character.	mai imagine hi kar sakta hu wo jo film me sarcastic joke marta hai. Caine perfect is character ke liye.
He has some gread monolouges	Uske pass kuch mahan monolouges hai
Batman intercepts a drug shipment, provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone, and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of the few honest cops left in Gotham, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets with Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare  him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane (which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the  word "Scarecrow"), and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating "the Scarecrow", Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply. He drugs Rachel with it, but Batman saves her and subdues Crane, who claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers the antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. Ducard reappears at Bruce's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him.	Batmain ek druag shipment ko accept karata hai, Rachel ko Falcone ke against saboot provide karaata hai, aur Sergeant James Gordon ko Gotham mein chhode gye kuchh imandaar police mein se ek ko arrest karane ke lie prerit karata hai. Jail mein, Falcone ek corrupt psychiatris Dr. Jonathan Crane ke saath milata hai, jise usane Gotham mein drugs ke taskai karane mein help ki hai, aur use maanasik roop se pareekshan ke liye. Crane ek scarecrow mask daalata hai aur ek bhay ke saath Falcone pe spray karta hai- use prerit karane vaale matibhram ko prerit karata hai (jisase Falcone shabd " Scarecrow " ko lagaataar munh mein le jaata hai), aur use Arkham Asylum mein transfer kara dita hai.

Jab Rachel ne Crane par corruption ka aarop lagaaya, to Crane ne khulaasa kiya ki voh apane fear-inducing drug ko Gotham ke pani mein daal deta hai. Veh iske saath Rachel ko drugs deta hai, lekin Batman use bachaata hai aur Crane ko vash mein karta hai, jo Ra's al Ghul ke lie kaam karne ka daava karata hai.

Interesting Scarecrow is even in the film. That seems like a lot of plot if they have multiple villans in the film.	Film mein Scarecrow bhi bahut dilchasap hai. Tab kafi saare plot lagte hai agr film mein bahut saare villans ho to.
How was the story in your opinion?	Apki raay se story kaisi thi?
It does not crowd the film in my opinion. Unlike how it turned out with Batman and Robin.	Mere raay se yeh film ko bhara hua nhi dikhate. Iske vipreet yeh Batman aur Robin ke saath kaise hua.
You can have multiple villians as long as you use them correctly	Tum bahut se villians le skte ho jab tak ki tum unhe achhe se use krte ho
I thought it was a great story. OVerall very solid	Mujhe lagta tha ki ye ek mahan kahani hai. Kul milaakar bahut solid
I agree,  does the League ever bump heads with Crane in the film?	Han main sehmat huin, kya Leagu kabhi film mein Cran ke saath sir kaatte hai?
Or do they work together?	Aur kya ve ek saath kaam karte hai?
Yes, and it fits naturally.	Han, aur yeh svaabhaavik roop se fit baithta hai.
Helllo	Hello
Hi, there.	Hi, there.
I guess we are to talk about the movie	Mujhe lagta hai hum Movie ke baare me baat kar rahe hai
Have you seen it	Kya tumne use dekha hai
Yeah - I wanted to talk about it because I like how David Fincher directed it. 	Yeah - me uske baare me baat karna chahta hun, jaise David Fincher ne ise direct kiya mujhe pasand aaya.
ok	Ok
Did you see it?	kya aap dekha?
did you enjoy it	kya aap enjoy kiya
yes i did	haan yar
Yeah, a lot. Sorkin and Fincher sure laced their scathing wit with an aching sadness, you know? I guess everybody says that, though.	bahut yar.. sorkin aur fincher tho apni aching sadness ko tho badiya scathing kare.. aapko patha hein? i guess ki sabhi aise hi sochthe honge..
ok, i wasnt aware it was based on a book	ok, muje iska koi aware nahi hein.. lekin yeh book ke based hoga
Yeah. Though I guess the movie isn't quite as factual as the book? And that the book is pretty heavily debated.	haan.. book se compare kare tho yeh movie itna bhi ache nahi hein kyon? aur book tho heavily debated tha
I see	acha
You remember that bit where Zuckerberg gets dumped and then writes a mean post about his ex?	aapko yaad hein ki zuckerberg tho kuch samai dumped tha aur voh apne ex se badi mean tha
Im not a fan of facebook or zukerbeg, but I thought the movie was well done.   I dont remember that part specifically	mein zukerberg ka fan nahi hoon, lekin movie tho badiya nikla.. muje uska yaad kuch nahi aatha
Yeah, no, I'm no fan of either, either. But it was that scene that kind said everything that needed to be said about the mentality behind that site. I thought that was pretty brilliant. 	haan yar, mein bhi uska fan nahi hoon.. lekin is scene mein tho kuch aise dekhaya gaya hein ki voh usse mentaly lead kar raha hein.. voh tho brilliant hein.
it seems to be highly rated	ye kafi high rated dikhti hai
Yeah. It's definitely a strong movie. I mean, it's a movie about Facebook that is actually watchable. That's saying something.	Han. ye definitely ek strong movie hai. Mera matlab, ye facebook par aisi movie hai jo watchable hai. Bahut badi baat hai.
yes Iwas thinking that as well	han main bhi yahi soch raha tha.
it is even more trajic where it has brought us politically	ye aur bhi tragic hai ki ye hume politically kahan le aya
For sure. And I feel like it's all in that bit where Sean Parker has his line about "You know what IS cool? A billion dollars." Like, it's presented as a way to keep people in touch, but it's really the coldest corporate-type of thing.	sach mein. Aur mujhe lagta hai ye sab usme bit mein hai jahan Sean Parker ki line hai "You know what IS cool? A billion dollars.". Like, ye aise way mein presented hai ki people touch mein rahein, par ye really bohat cold-corporate type ki thing hai
yes greed is powerfull	han greed powerful hai
Did you know Sean Parker was the founder of Napster?	kya tum jante ho Sean Parker Napster ka founder tha
yes	yes
it is interesting how he suggested getting rid of "the"	ye interesting hai kaise usne 'the' se rid karne ka suggest.
Yes! I was just about to say that.  I think it's crazy how much influence he had on Facebook when it started out.	han! main wahi bolne wala tha. Mujhe lagta hai ye crazy hai uske pas kitna zyada influence tha jab facebook start hua.
Then there's that last scene, where Zuckerberg keeps refreshing his page to see if his ex-girlfriend has accepted his friend request. That's what it all comes back to. After all the greed, you've still got these human needs.	Aur ek last sceme hai, jahan Zuckerberg apne page ko refresh karta rahta hai yeh dekhne ke liye ki kya uske ex-girlfriend ne uska friend request accept kiya hai ya nahin. Last mein yehi sab hota hai. Saare greed ke baad, tumhe human needs ki zaroorat hai.
it is interesting for sure	Hann. Yeh zaroor interesting hai.
it would be funny if it was still called f acemash	Bahut funny hota agar ise abhi bhi facemash kaha jaata.
I know, that was a pretty weird name. Even 'Facebook' seemed weird back in the day.	Mujhe pata hai ki woh ek achcha weird naam tha.  Un dino mein Facebook bhi weird hua karta tha.
i think it is a dangerous false reality that has changed humanity for  the worse	Mujhe lagta hai yeh ek khatarnak flase reality hai jisne humanity ko bilkul badal diya hai.
millions are addicted to it, and it is proven to shape perceptions in false ways	Lakhon log iske peeche addicted hain and maana jaata hai ki yeh perceptions ko galat tareeke se shape karta hai.
Yeah, I think so, too. Though I also think there is a natural balance of humanity and that at some point Facebook will be left in the dust. Or at least it's worst aspects will be. Again, I just think about that last scene. Maybe it's too optimistic, but I think people will abandon Facebook. Maybe not this generation, but the next.	Haan, mujhe bhi aisa hi lagta hai.  Par mujhe aisa bhi lagta hai ki humanity ka ek natural balance bhi hai magar kabhi na kabhi Facebook dust mein mil jayega.  Ya, kam se kam uske worst aspects dust mein honge.  Main phie se us last sceme ke baare mein sochta hoon.  Ho sakta hai main bahut optimistic hoon, but mere khayal se log Facebook abandon kar denge.  Yeh generation nahin to agla generation.
Was there anything you didn't like about the movie?	Movie mein kya aisa kuch tha jo tumne like nahin kiya?
it seems to be in that direction to some point already.  a lot of damage has been done though	Haan, kuch had tak mujhe laga ki us direction mein ja raha hai.  Kaafi had tak damage to ho chuka hai.
I think we are done now, have a good day	I think baat khatam ho gayi.  Tumhara din achcha ho.
Okay, You too!	Okay, tum bhi!

Hello!	Hello?
Hello so the movie we will be talking about is Batman V. Superman	Hello to hum aaj jis movie k baare me baat karege wo hai Batman V Superman
Great! I haven't actually seen that yet, but have been really wanting to. Which actors play Batman and Superman?	Great, maine abhi tak wo dekhi nahi hai, but sahi me dekhna chahta hu. Batman aur Superman kaun actors bane hai?
The actors are really great and you probably know all of them. Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, and Jesse Eisenberg to name a few.	Actor bohot aache hai, aur tum shaiyad sabko jante ho. Ben affleck, henry cavill, amy adams, aur jesse eisenberg kuch naam hai
Oh, that is a great cast? Henry Cavill played Superman in the latest Superman film right?	Oh ye to bohot aachi cast hai? Henry cavill ne superman ka kirdaar nibhaya tha na latest superman film me?
Sorry, a great cast!	Maaf karna, ek aachi cast!
I am not sure but the film is still a part of the DC extended universe. Also it will be featuring wonder woman.	Mai nahi bol sakta lekin film ek part hai DC extended universe ka. Aur vo naya kirdar wonder women bhi dikhayenge
Ooh, that is excellent. I am looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman! Are Batman and Superman enemies at the start of the film?	Ye to kaafi aacha hai. Mai wonder women ko deekhna chahunga! Kyaa batman aur superman dushman hai movie chalu hote samay
Well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with Superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman.	Kyaa lex luthor uksayega batman ko ek ladai ke liye superman ke saath kyunki vo obssessed hai clone superman se
Oh! So Batman is supposed to bring Superman to Lex Luthor?	Oh! batman superman ko lex luthor ke paas lekar jata hai
No that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping. By the way did I mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together?	Nahi ye case nahi hai jabki vo uksata hai madat karne ko. Kyaa maine bataya ke ye pehli baar hai ke batman aur superman ek saath movie me hai?
Really? The first time? That seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long! Very cool. Is the story set in Metropolis or Gotham?	Sahi me? Pehli baar? Ye kaafi aacha sunai deta hai ke kirdaar aas paas rahe hai itne samay se! Kaafi aacha. Ye story metropolis me hai ya gotham me?
The film appears to take place in both cities, and Batman comes to view Superman as a threat to humanity.	Film dono jagah hoti hai, aur batman superman ko ek khatre ke tarah deekhta hai manavta ke liye
That is interesting, to have the film set in both cities. So Batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take Superman down?	Yeh interesting hai, dono cities mein film set hona. to Batman ne Superman ko neecha le jana kuch hadd tak apni duty mani hai?
Well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because Clark Kent A.K.A. Superman learns of Batman's justice methods and tries to expose him. All this happening while Lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator.	Khair characters ke relationships kafi complex hai kyunki  Clark Kent A.K.A. Superman Batman ke justice krne ke tarike sikh gya hai or use expose krne ki koshish krta hai. Ye sab tab hota hai jan Lex Luthor ek senator se kryptonite lene ka approval lene ke liye chaalein chalta hai.
Interesting. And so, I imagine Lois Lane is in this story? If so, does she serve a greater purpose? Does she know both superheroes?	Dilachasp. Aur isliye, mujhe lagta hai ki kahani mein Lois Lane hai? Agar aisa hai to, kya wo koi bada purpose serve kr rahi hai? Kya use dono superheroes ke baare mein pta hai?
Maybe but I am not sure. By the way do you usually care about reviews?	Shayad but main sure nhi huin. Vaise tum aamataur par reviews ki paravaah karte ho?
I will often read reviews to see what people have to say, but I don't change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews. I think that I can't really know unless I see for myself. Do you care about reviews?	Main aksar reviews ko padhta hoon ki logon ka kya kahana hai, lekin main reviews ke aadhaar par movie dekhne ke baare mein apana mann nahin badalata huin. Mujhe lagata hai ki main vaastav mein tab tak nahin jaan sakta jab tak ki main kud se nahi dekhta. Kya tum reviews ki paravaah karte ho?
Not usually I like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not I watch in theatres. I have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed. 	Aamataur par main apana khud ka judge banna pasand karta huin lekin agar reviews bahut bure ya achhe hai to yeh influence kar sakta hai ki main cinema main dekhta hoon ya nahin. Mujhe is movie ke lie kehna hoga, haalaanki reviews kaafi mixed hai.
Did you enjoy this film?	Kya tumne ye film enjoy ki?
I did. I really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman.	Han. Mujhe vaastav mein un scenes ko dekhna pasand tha jahaan batman superman ko vash mein karne ke arrangements karta hai.
Cool. I guess that's one of the ultimate questions, which one could beat out the other. Do they team up at all in the film ?	Badiya. Mujhe lagata hai ki yeh param savaalon mein se ek hai, kaun dusre ko hara sakta hai. Kya ve film mein team up krte hai?
Yes in Batman chooses to save Supermans mother while Superman confonts Lex.	Han Batman Superman ki maa ko bachaane ko chunta hai jabaki superman Lex ka saamana karta hai.
Oh wow! The pairing of Batman and Superman's mom is a really cool part of the story, heartwarming.	tho acha hein! yeh tho batman aur superman ka mummy ka pairing hein jo bahut cool hein aur heartwarming hein
I know but the film ends with sadly the death of Superman.	muje patha tha lekin is film ka end tho superman ka mouth tho bada sad huva
Oh wow! I am surprised by that, I thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two. 	are vah! mein tho surprised huva, lekin mein soch raha hoon ki is story line tho dusra movie se likha gaya hein
Dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the Director.	coffin ka vibrates ke baare mein koi worry na kare. kyon ki is wink us director ka hein
Haha! That's the closing shot?!	ha ha.. yeh tho closing shot nikhla
I believe so it is in the last scene.	mein believe kartha ki voh last scene se hein
Awesome! Take care.	awesome yar.. dhyan rakhna
hello	HELLO
Hello. Have you watched The Social Network? It was a surprisingly good movie.	HELLO. KYA AAP SOCIAL NETWORK DEKHA HAIN? vah aascharya se ek achha movie tha
I have not	mere paas nahi hai
It sounds like a good film	vah ek achha film lagtha hai
Yes, I'm here	yes, main edar hoon
The performances were great. Justin Timberlake is not only a talented singer but a pretty good actor as well. Jesse Eisenberg fit the part very well too.	pradarshan bahut achha tha. justin timberlake na sirf ek achha singer hain ,ek achha actor bhee hai. jesse Eisenberg bhi apna bhaag achi tarah nibaya
Hello?	hello
Hello	Hello
I'm here	main yahan hoon
I was just going to ask how Timberlake was as an actor	main just puchne wala tha  as an actor Timberlake  kaisa hai
Hi. I was saying how Justin Timberlake and Jesse Eisenberg were pretty good actors.	Hi, main keh raha tha kaise Justin Timberlake aurJesse Eisenberg kaafi ache actors hain
Yeah. He's better than I thought he would be.	Yeah. maine jaisa socha tha wo usse better hai
I'm not usually into Biographies 	main aksar Biographies main dilchaspi nahi leta
Me neither but this one was pretty good. 	Me neither,lekin ye kaafi achi thi
But this one is probably a decent one to watch	lekin shayad ye dekhne ke liye decent  hai
It's crazy how fast Fb blew up	It's crazy kaise jaldi Fb udh gaya
It would be interesting to watch the film	film dekhna interesting hoga
It is. I didn't think Mark Zuckerberg had a very interesting life but I guess he has.	yeh aise hi hei.. muje nahi lagtha ki Mark Zuckerberg ke paas interesting life hoga
Facebook is a monster.	Facebook tho yek monster hein
I don't think most people could live without it at this point in time.	muje nahi lagtha ki uske bina koi log jee nahi sakthe.
I bet. He was pretty young when he made fb wasn't he	muje patha hein ki voh pretty young hein jab fb mein nahi tha
It's kind of messed up though. Zuckerberg was accused of stealing someone else's ideas to get started.	yeh thoda messed up jaisa tha.. zuckerberg tho dusron ka idea steal kiya aur apne company startup kiya.
Yeah. He was still in college.	haan. yeh tho abhi bhi college mein hein
Yeah, too many people relay on fb now! 	haan, jyada people fb mein hein ab
I know. It's fun but people use it a little too much.	muje patha hein.. yeh fun hein lekin people tho jyada hi istamal karte
The movie doesn't really go into that though. They need to do a sequel that talks about how FB has affected society.	is movie tho itna bhi ache nahi hein.. voh thoda sequel se baath karne chahiye ki kaise FB is society ko affect huva hein.
yeah, that would be cool to see	haan, yeh sahi baath hein.
more of a documentary  of sorts. 	Documentary of sorts se jyada
It started out as a simple chat to help college students with dating but turned into something much bigger.	Ye ek Simple chat se start hua jo ki college students ki dating me help karne ke liye tha but ye kuch bahut bade me turn ho gaya
Kind of a dramatized documentary though.	ek  Dramatized Documentary ki tarah though.
lol, right!	lol, right!
Tell me about the movie	MOVIE KE BAARE MEIN BATAIE

I love her voice!	humko oosi voice ko pyar hai
I like that Anna was fearless, and didn't act like your typical Disney princess.	hum anna ko nidar pasand hai phir hum disney princess kaary na karthey
That's right...she's extroverted and fun!	bhohut accha... oosi bahirmukhee phir aanand hey
The first part of the movie, explaining how the sisters were orphaned, and how their circumstances drove them apart was tragic, but I do like how everything wrapped up in the end.	pratham ansh ka chalachitr , samajhaana bahanon ko kaise anaath the , aur kaise unake haalaat unhen alag kar diya dukhad tha, lekin mujhe pasand hai kaise sab kuchh ant mein lapeta hua

Do you have any other favorite film?	apke pas khoie pasand film hai

A few, but I thought for purposes of this exercise, we must confine our conversation to the information in the document?	kuchh, lekin mainne is abhyaas ke uddeshyon ke lie socha, hamen apanee baatacheet ko dastaavez mein dee gaee jaanakaaree tak hee seemit rakhana chaahie?
That's correct	yah sahee hai
What is your rating for Frozen?	phrojan ke lie aapakee reting kya hai?
The document is growing, and additional detailed information about scenes from the movie were just added.  I'm reminded of the scene where Elsa builds her ice palace.  It was an impressive bit of computer generated animation.	dastaavez badh raha hai, aur philm ke drshyon ke baare mein atirikt vistrt jaanakaaree bas jod dee gaee. mujhe us drshy kee yaad aa rahee hai jahaan elsa apane barph ke mahal ka nirmaan karatee hai. yah kampyootar dvaara utpann eneemeshan ka ek prabhaavashaalee sa tha.
I would rate Frozen as an 80%, or 8 out of 10. 	main frozain0%, ya ratai mein se ratai ke roop mein phrojan ret karoonga.
Yeah, the animation was outstanding	haan, eneemeshan bakaaya tha
My favorite scene is when Anna gets hitby Elsa  at the very beginning.	mera pasandeeda drshy tab hai jab shuruaat mein hee ena ne elsa ko hit kar diya.
The Duke of Weselton has a name that looks suspiciously like the term weasel !	dyook oph vesalatan ka ek naam hai jo spasht roop se vaisal shabd kee tarah dikhata hai!
I like all the scenes with musical numbers in them.	mujhe unamen myoozikal nambar vaale sabhee seen pasand hain.
What did you like the least about the film?	philm ke baare mein aapako kya pasand aaya?
I did not like that the parents died	mujhe yah pasand nahin tha ki maata-pita mar gae
did you know that there is a scene where rapunzel appears in Frozen?	kya aap jaanate hain ki vahaan ek drshy hai jahaan raipanzel jame hue dikhaee deta hai?
The parents dying was sad and unexpected, and a dramatic way to start the film	marane vaale maata-pita udaas aur apratyaashit the, aur philm shuroo karane ka ek naatakeey tareeka
I did not know that Rapunzel appeared in Frozen. 	mujhe nahin pata tha ki raipanzel phrojan mein dikhaee die.
Yeah, very briefly	haan, bahut sankshep mein
I have to agree it's the best Disney animated film in quite a few years... since the Lion King.	loyan king ke baad se mujhe sahamat hona padega ki yah kuchh saalon mein sabase behatareen dijnee enimeted philm hai.
Yeah, the best film in modern animation.	haan, aadhunik eneemeshan mein sabase achchhee philm.

The movie follows their adventure Zootopia.	Yeh ek Optimistic Rabbit ke baar mein hai Zootopia Police Department join karta hai. jobki woh ek red fox chalati hai aur woh ek small time con artist bhi hai jisko Jason Bateman ne play kiya hai.  Movie uske Zootopia adventure ko follow karti hai
that sounds really interesting. How does the movie end?	yeh sunne mein toh bhaut interesting hai.  Movie ka end kaisa hai
would you watch it again?	Kya tum dubara dekhoge?
I would watch it again. I saw it in theaters so I am not positive on how it ends but i know that it ends with the Rabbit officer proving that she may be small but she wont be intimidated and will do her job to the best of her abilities.	Han main dubara dekhunga. Maine ye theater mein dekhi thi so main sahi se nhi bta skta ki ye end kaise hui but mujhe ye pta hai ki ye rabbit officer ke saath end hui thi jo ye saabit krta hai ki wo chhoti ho skti hai par dari hui nhi ho skti or apni ability ke according kam karegi.
she sounds like a great officer.	Wo ek mahan officer ki tarah sound krti hai.
She was quite inspiring. 	Wo kafi inspire karti hai
who plays all the voices in the movie?	Film mein saari awaazein kisne di hai?
Ginnifer Goodwin is Officer Judy Hopps, Jason Bateman plays Nick Wilde, Idris Elba is Chief Bogo, and Jenny Slate is Dawn Bellwether.	Officer Judy Hopps ki Ginnifer Goodwin ne, Nick Wilde ki Jason Bateman ne, Chief Bogo ki Idris Elba ne or Dawn Bellwether ki Jenny Slate ne awaaz di hai.
those are all great voices. Do you think this movie is okay for kids?	Yeh sabhi awaazein bahut mahaan hai. Kya tujhe lagta hai ki ye fim bachon ke liye sahi hai?
I think it is a great movie for kids and adults alike.	Mujhe lagta hai ki yeh movie bachon or adults dono ke liye achhi hai.
would you consider it to be a comedy?	Kya tum ise comedy ki samjh skte ho?
Yes.	Han.
would you recommend it to your best friend?	Kya tum recommend it to your best friend?
Yes.	Haan yes
do you think that they will make a second movie of this?	Kya tumhe lagta hain ki they will make a second movie of this?
There is some potential for a second movie. But I am not sure what they would use for a premise. 	There is some potential for a second movie. Par I am not sure iski prishthbhumi ke liye what they  would use.
thats very true, a sequal is easier said than done.	Ekdum sahi, a sequal is easier said than done.
They cannot try to use the little guy beats the big guy in the next one since the officer proved her self already.	Woh cannot try to use the little guy beats the big guy in the next one kyunki officer proved her self already.
maybe a little guy can beat the officer	Ho sakta hai ki little guy beat the officer
like the rocket snail	Rocket snail ki tarah.
That could be true, but do we want to see a movie where the bad guy wins?	Woh sahi ho sakta hai, but kya hum want to see a movie where the bad guy wins?
true but than they could make a third movie where the officer learns how to defeat the guy eventually.	Sahi hai but than they could make a third movie jahan officer learns bure logo ko kaisse defeat kare..
I see your point. I fear that you may dissuade people from watching a third movie if they were put off from seeing the villain win in the second movie.	I see your point. Lekin kujhe darr hai ki you may dissuade people from watching a third movie agar unko second movie mein villian ka jeetna pasand nahi aaya .
It does open up the plot to a third movie but would rather see a cliffhanger than the enemy win.	Ye third movie ke liye plot open karta to hai lekin would rather see a cliffhanger than the enemy win.
thats true! no one at the end of the day wants to see the enemy win.	ye sach hai! at the end of the day koi dushman ko jeette hue nahi dekhna chahta.
Do you think there was a hidden message in the movie?	Tumhe lagta hai ki movie mein koi hidden message hai.
I think the message was to be patient and not judge people or in the movies case animals based on the stereotypes that you have gathered. 	Mere vichar se message tha patience rakhne ka aur logon ko ya is movie ke case mein animals ko  judge nahi karne ka based on your stereotypes .
Hello! Have you seen the movie La La Land?	aap kese ho! kya tumne La La land movie dekhi?
No I haven't.	No, maine nahi dekhi.
What is it about?	yah kis baare mein hai?
It's really good! It's a musical/romantic comedy about two people who fall in love in Hollywood.	ye sachamuch achchha hai! yah do logon ke baare mein ek sangeetamay / romaantik komedee hai jo holeevud mein pyaar karate hain.
Who are the main actors?	mukhy abhineta kaun hain?
Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the two main characters.	rayaan gosaling aur emma ston do mukhy paatr hain.
Are they the characters that fall in love?	kya ve paatr hain jo pyaar mein pad jaate hain?
They are. One's a jazz pianist and the other is an aspiring actress.	vo hain. ek jaij piyaanovaadak aur doosara ek mahatvaakaankshee abhinetree hai.
What is the conflict?	sangharsh kya hai?
There isn't really a major conflict, the movie just follows these two characters as they fall in love.	vaastav mein ek bada sangharsh nahin hai, philm sirph in do paatron ka anusaran karatee hai kyonki ve pyaar mein pad jaate hain.
There are several dance numbers that are really well done.	kaee daans nambar hain jo vaastav mein achchhee tarah se kie gae hain.
Is it a musical?	yah ek sangeet hai?
Yes, it is a musical.	haan, yah ek sangeet hai.
Are there any current pop stars who are in it?	kya koee vartamaan pop staar hain jo isamen hain?
They meet for the first time when he's playing a jazz improvisation and the music draws her into the restaurant.	ve pahalee baar milate hain jab vah ek jaiz improovament khel raha hota hai aur sangeet use restaraan mein kheenchata hai.
John Legend is in the film.	jon leejend philm mein hain.
Is it love at first sight? 	kya yah pahalee najar mein pyaar hai?
Kind of. She falls in love with his music, then gets to know him better and better throughout the film.	ek prakaar ka. use apane sangeet se pyaar ho jaata hai, phir pooree philm mein use behatar aur behatar tareeke se jaanane lagatee hai.
Who is the director of the film?	philm ka nirdeshak kaun hai?
It's directed by Damien Chazelle.	yah demiyan chejel dvaara nirdeshit hai.
Never heard of them. What other movies have they been the director?	unake baare mein kabhee nahin suna. nirdeshak ke roop mein unakee kaun see any philmen hain?
He directed Whiplash as well, which is another film about music.	unhonne vhipalaish ko bhee nirdeshit kiya, jo sangeet ke baare mein ek aur philm hai.
I like it because the characters are falling in love as they're following their dreams.	mujhe yah pasand hai kyonki paatron ko pyaar ho raha hai kyonki ve apane sapanon ka paalan kar rahe hain.
Do you know who does the choreography for La La Land ? 	kya aap jaanate hain ki la la laind ke lie koriyograaphee kaun karata hai?

What kind of movies do you like?	aap kis tarah kee philmen pasand karate hain?
I enjoy things where I have to think. Or that have strange plot twists. Like Memento. Or Predestination. Where you don't understand everything until the very end.	main un cheejon ka aanand leta hoon jahaan mujhe sochana hai. ya ki ajeeb saajish mod hai. memento kee tarah. ya poorvaabhaas. jahaan aap bahut ant tak sab kuchh nahin samajhate hain.
Are there other movies like La La Land that you could compare to it?	kya la la laind jaisee any philmen hain jinase aap isakee tulana kar sakate hain?
Cool! Well then you might not like La La Land. It's a bit more straightforward and focuses more on relationships and the characters.	thanda! to phir aap la la laind pasand nahin kar sakate hain. yah thoda adhik seedha hai aur rishton aur paatron par adhik dhyaan kendrit karata hai.
I like all kinds of movies. Are there other films that you could compare La La Land to?	mujhe sabhee tarah kee philmen pasand hain. kya aisee any philmen hain jinase aap la la laind kee tulana kar sakate hain?
It's kind of a unique type of movie. It has a lot in common with movies from the 1920s that have lots of dance and musical numbers.	yah ek anokhee kism kee philm hai. yah 1920 ke dashak kee philmon ke saath bahut kuchh hai jisamen bahut saare nrty aur sangeet sankhyaen hain.
It's very well-made. Lots of critics seem to have enjoyed it.	yah bahut achchhee tarah se banaaya gaya hai. lagata hai ki aalochakon ne isaka bharapoor aanand liya hai.

Why not La La land? Do you not like it?	kyon nahin la la laind? kya aapako yah pasand nahin hai?

LA LA land is OK but it doesn't compare to the action of Jews. I give it a 7.8 whereas jaws is a 9.1	la la bhoomi theek hai, lekin yah yahoodiyon kee kaarravaee kee tulana nahin karata hai. main ise 7.8 deta hoon jabaki jabade 9.1 hai
LA LA land is a musical romantic Comedy	la la bhoomi ek sangeetamay romaantik komedee hai
Hmm, you might have to convince me a little more about Jaws just because I already know the ending. Since you said LA LA Land is a romantic comedy, is there any romance in Jaws?	hamm, tum mujhe jabade ke baare mein thoda aur samajhaane ke lie ho sakata hai kyonki main pahale se hee ant jaanata hoon. jab se aapane kaha tha ki la la laind ek romaantik komedee hai, kya joz mein koee romaans hai?

yea thats true, also Nolan isnt known for his sense of humour	haan, yah sach hai, Nolan bhee apane sense of humour ke lie nahin jaana jaata he
oh just remmbered why 1940 was so captivating. it was the start of WWII so...thats makes it even more depressing	oh abhee yaad aaya ki 1940 kyon itana captivating tha. Yah WWII kee shuruaat thee isalie ... isane ise aur bhee depressing bana diya
The critics have given it a rave reviews, and it has a good chance at he oscars	aalochakon ne ise rave reviews diya hai, aur ise ek accha chance hai oscars ke liye

Personally ye aisi movie nahi lagti jo mujhe chi lage. Ye boring lagti hai aur isey C Cinema Score mila to shayad ye mere opinion ko support karta hai.
Oh okay. Who are the lead actors ?	Oh okay. lead actors kon hain?
It says the genre is a "black comedy". Do you know what that is because I do not. I'm thinking it is a "dark" comedy as in mood and attitude and not racial.	ye to kehti hai ki iska genre "black comedy" hai. Kya tumhe pata hai kyunki mujhe nahi pata, mujhe lag raha hai ye as in mood and attitude "dar" comedy hai na ki racial.
The lead actors are Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Kyle Chandler, and Rob Reiner. I do not know who Kyle Chandler is.	lead actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Kyle Chandler, and Rob Reiner hain. Mujhe nahi pata Kyle Chandler kon hain.
There are big names	ye bade naam hain
I see it was based on a true story.	I see ki ye tre story pe based hai
Leonardo was nominated for Oscar for this.	Leonardo iske liye Oscar nominate hua
Where are you located ?	AAP KAHAAN HAIN?
Oh he is a good actor, probably deserved it.	OH VAH EK ACHCHHE ABHINETA HAIN, SHAAYAD ISAKE HAKADAAR HAIN.
I'm located in Maryland. I thought we aren't suppose to give personal information.	MAIN MAIREELAIND MEIN STHIT HOON. MAINNE SOCHA THA KI HAM VYAKTIGAT JAANAKAAREE DENE KE LIE NAHIN HAIN.
Wolf of Wall street is pretty famous in the US.	VULPH OPH VOL SADAK AMERIKA MEIN BAHUT PRASIDDH HAI.
It just seemed a little bizarre to me that someone didn't know that movie,so I asked.	YAH SIRPH MUJHE THODA VICHITR LAGA KI KOEE US PHILM KO NAHIN JAANATA HAI, ISALIE MAINNE POOCHHA.
Yes. I've heard of it but never seen it. I like action movies.	HAAN. MAINNE ISAKE BAARE MEIN SUNA HAI LEKIN ISE KABHEE NAHIN DEKHA. MUJHE EKSHAN PHILMEN PASAND HAIN.
Okay. I recommend trying to watch it, it's a great movie.	THEEK HAI. MAIN ISE DEKHANE KEE KOSHISH KARANE KEE SALAAH DETA HOON, YAH EK BEHATAREEN PHILM HAI.
I think my husband and daughter have watched it buy not me. Again, I like action movies but my husband loves watching gangster and comedies. He always teases me that I only want to watch action movies for the actors.	MUJHE LAGATA HAI KI MERE PATI AUR BETEE NE ISE KHAREEDA HAI, MUJHE NAHIN. PHIR SE, MUJHE EKSHAN PHILMEN PASAND HAIN LEKIN MERE PATI KO GAINGASTAR AUR KOMEDEE DEKHANA BAHUT PASAND HAI. VAH HAMESHA MUJHE CHIDHAATE HAIN KI MAIN KEVAL ABHINETAON KE LIE EKSHAN PHILMEN DEKHANA CHAAHATA HOON.
Haha, is he right ?]	HAAHA, KYA VAH SAHEE HAI?]
I might have to. I am more of a book person so since it's based on a book written by the main character I would be more apt to read the book.	MUJHE KARANA PAD SAKATA HAI. MAIN EK PUSTAK VYAKTI SE ADHIK HOON, KYONKI YAH MUKHY CHARITR DVAARA LIKHEE GAEE PUSTAK PAR AADHAARIT HAI ISALIE MAIN PUSTAK KO PADHANE KE LIE ADHIK UPAYUKT HOGA.
Yeah, sometimes he is right that is why I watch the action movies lol.	ha, kabhi vo sahi hoti hai ki mai kyo avtion moive dekhta hu
The movie is based on a book.	yah mmoive book me based hai
The summary of the movie seems kind of depressing. The main character doesn't seem honest and he gets arrested. I'm guessing he overall learned his lesson since he wrote a book about his life story.	ish moive ki summary depressing hai,moive ka character imandar nahi malum parta aur vah arrest ho jata hai,muje lagta hai vah apni life se seek leta haijab vah book liogta hai
It actually sounds sad to me. Someone that has the potential to make alot of money at work and ends up getting greedy and corrupt and ruins their life.	muje yah accha nahi laga,jab kisi me bahut kuch kare ki abuility par lalach ke chhaker me vah bhrast ho jata aur apni life barbad kar leta haiha moive kafi entertaining
Yeah, the movie is pretty entertaining. The summary might have been written by an emo. Lol. The entire movie is fun, other than the last 10 mins or so.	ha moive kafi entertaining  hai.sayad summary emo ne likhi hai,puri moive majedar hai last ke das min ke siva
Overall he ended up fine. Has a family and everything	kulmilakar ant acha tha,uske pas parivar aur sabkuch tha
He is on TV sometimes as a guest 	kuch samay ke liye vah t.v par guest tha
Oh well that's good. I see he went to jail for 3 years. That's not too long. I wonder if he truly regrets ruining his life or just regrets losing all the money.	oh yah thik tha,vah teen saal ke liye jail gaya vah jayada time nahi hota achyar use sach me dukh hua apni jingi ka ya keval paise barbad hone ka
He made that money quick and easy, while cheating the stock market.	usne ashan aur quick paisa kamaya jabki usne stock market ko luta
He must be a really intelligent person, what a shame to waste all that talent.	vah yek intelligent vaykti tha,bari sarm hai ki sara talent barbad ho gaya
3 years was nothing.	3 saal se kuch nahi
Yeah, 3 years is short.	haan, 3 saal tho short hein
Well, he still is a millionaire.	well, voh ab bhi millionaire  hein
Oh wow. That I didn't know and it doesn't say. Except it says he hid $22 million in a Swiss account. Is that how he's still a millionaire?	are wow, muje is bare mein kuch nahi patha. except us 22$ million ka swiss account.. tho aise hi voh millionaire huve?
Even if he lost all the money he made previously, his movie deal, book deal and speaking fees has made him millions	agar voh previously saare money lost kiya tha lekin voh movie ko ache tarah deal kiya, book ko bhi,, aur kahi millions tho apne speaking fees se banaya
Do you know if he has a new family because it says his 2nd wife Naomi wanted a divorce and full custody of their children.	aapko patha hein, agar usse new family hota tho uska 2nd wife jo naomi tho jarur divorce karthi
I don't know much in detail but ,I watched him talk about his daughter once and he seemed pretty happy about where he is now.	muje itna detail nahi patha, mein unka daughter aur unka talk dekha hein, thoda happy nazar aa rahe the
He does say that he has made mistakes in his life.	voh kahathe hei ki yahi unka life ka mistakes hein
Oh well that's good. I do like movies (and books) based on real life stories.	acha sahi, muje is tarah ka movies jaise real life stories dekhna pasand hein
Try watching it , its a good one.	mein bhi try karunga, acha hein
Looks like we did good on the chat	ham baate karme mei achche lag rahe the
I think I might have to. If it keeps my attention through the first 30 minutes I'll keep watching it. Sometimes I cheat and wikipedia movies to see what they are about before watching them.	mera khayal hai mere pass hai. yadi usne mera attention 30 min ke liye le liya to mei dhekhunga. khabhi kabhi mei movei dekhane se pahale Wikipedia mei dekhata hui
yes, I think this is a good chat.	haa, mere khayalhai ki ye bahut achi baate hai

and I guess Hugh used to be good at robot fighting but then they had some problems and they weren't good anymore.	aur mujhe lagata hai ki hyoog robot kee ladaee mein achchha hua karata tha, lekin tab unhen kuchh samasyaen theen aur ve ab achchhe nahin the
But then they find a better robot and are good again.	lekin phir ve ek behatar robot dhoondhate hain aur phir se achchhe hote hain
seemed like a simplistic popcorn movie from the previews	previews se lagtha hein ki, yeh kuch simplistic popcorn movie hein
I guess not WWE, but boxing, less humans, just robots	wwe ka tho nahi hein, lekin boxing, less humans aur robots ke tho jarur hoga
yeah	haan
Honestly it seems dumb, orobably why I did not see it	honestly, muje dumb lagtha, kuch dekhai nahi detha
probably made my disney too, so it could be a kiddy movie	probably, yeh disney ka hein, jo kiddy movie hein
does not sound kiddy	kiddy ke tarah kuch sound nahi aatha
I don't think it was a mature movie though, it was marketed towards kids (teens)	muje nahi lagtha ki yeh mature movie hein, kids ke tarah hi hey
not little kids	choti kids ke nahi
like the kind of movie you'd take a 14 year old to	14 saal ka kids ke hein
In fact now that I read this, it sounds like one of the movies that is so stupid it might be "stupid enjoyable"	mein ab bhi isse padthi hoon, stupid ke tarah sound kar raha hein lekin muje is stupid tho enjoy karthi hoon
Yeah, it definitely sounds like that.	ha, ye definitely uski tarah sound karta he.
probably a feel good movie where they conquer all	probably ye ek feel good movie he jisme vi sabkuch conquer kar lete he
Does it say what kind of problems they have in that document?	kya ye kahata he ki unhe us document me kis type ki problem aayi.
like what the main plot is about	jese ki main plot kis bare me he
This also sounds like that , I think, Brad pitt movie about underground fight venues	ye bhi vesa hi sound karta he,mujhe lagata he, Bred Pitt movies underground fight venues ki bar me hoti he.
yeah except nobody is crazy like the brad pitt character	ha Koi bhi other character Brad PItt ke character ki tarah crazy nahi he
Illegal, mush be done out of the view of the law	illegal, law ki view ke outside kiya jana chahiye
I don't think it was illegal	me nahi sochta ki illegal tha
maybe though	although hosakta he
I remember there were crowds of people cheering them on	mujhe remember he ki crowd vahan unhe cheer kar raha tha
like it was an athletic specacle 	Wo ek athletic specacle jesa tha
the write up says Now working as a small-time promoter, Charlie pieces together scrap metal into low-end fighters, barely earning enough to make it from one underground venue to the next. 	Write up bol raha he ki aap ek small time promoter ki tara he,charlie pieces scrap metal into low end fighters, barely utna kama raha heki wo usme sebek underground venue to the next
yup that's the struggle	Ha wo struggle tha
then they find an amazing robot and get their revenge	Bad me wo ek amazing robot find kar rahe the aur bdla liya
so he starts out as illegal, then moves up in the world	Usne illegap start kiya,bad me world me move up ho gaye
makes sense	Samaj me aata he
do you know if the robots have an intelligence?	Kya aap ko pata he ki robot ke pass intelligence hota hai?
Rotten Tomatos 59% rating	Rotten tomatoes ke fifty nine percent rating he
who cares about rotten tomatoes, their reviews are worthless	Rotton tomatoes kaun care karta he,uske reviews worthless he
Says it was made by Dream Works, is that adisney company?	Kaho wo Dream works ne banaya he,jo adisney company he?
look up your fav movies on that site and I guarantee you'll be disappointed  by the low scores. 	Tum es site par apni manpasand films dekho aur main guarantee se kehta hoon ke itna kmm score dekh ke nirash ho jaoge
no I think they compete with disney	Nhi, main sochta hoon ke uhno ne Disney poora kar lia
they make similar animated movies	Woh ek tran ki animated movies bnate hain
It seems Disney buys up everyone	Aisa lagta hai Disney ne sab kuch khareed lia
yeah, they are a giant company. 	Hanji, woh ek bade company hai
gives another rating of 56% (Metric score) ???	Woh 56% hor rating deti hai(metric score)???
that is probably a rating at a different site	Yeh ton pkka ek alag rating hai site pe
I've done this before and usually they provide 3 rating systems	Maine ye Pehla bhi kia hai aur har baar je 3 rating system dete hain
rottoen tomatoes, something else then a cine something rating	Rotten tomatoes, eske ila a kuch hor cine rating
Also stars Olga Fonda, is she related to Jane Fonda/Henry Fonda?	Osne hero Olga fonda hai, kya woh Jane fonda/Henry fonda KI najdiki hai
I have no idea	mujhe koi idea nahin hai
Yes a CinemaScore:A	haan ek CinemaScore:A hai
they always have suspiciously high ratings	uske hamesha suspicously jyaada ratings hain
seems like Olga was born in Russia, so no, much better looking than Henry or Jane	lagta hai Olga ka janam Russia me hua tha, so nahin, Henry or Jane ko dekhne se much better hai
lol	lol
I think we're done now, thanks for the chat!	mujhe lagta haich hamari khatam ho chuki, chat ke liye thanks!
ok	ok
bye	bye
Hello!	me apna head bow karta hu
Hello! Today we're gonna talk about How to Train Your Dragon	i bow mera sar!Today hum bat karne wale he ki tumhare Dragon ko train kese kare.
Have you seen it before?	kya you seen it pahle?
Awesome.  No, I have not had the chance, is it good?	Bahut badiya. nahi, mujhe chance nahi mila, kya ye good hua?
Yes it has great ratings! It is rated 7.9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes	yes iskogreat rating mili he!  Rotten Tomatoes par iski rating 7.9/10 he
Who is in it?  Is it an animated movie?	kon he isme?kya ye ek animated movie he?
The cast includes Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, and America Ferrera	iski cast me Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson and American Ferrera ko include kiya gaya he.
They all do an amazing job, and yes it is animated.	ye sab amazing job karte he aur ha ye animated he.
OMG Craig Ferguson is a riot!	Hea God Craig Ferguson to swayam hi riot he!
Yes he does such a great job!! The #d work is truly magical	ha voh bahut hi great perform karta he!! 3D work to really magical he
What is it about, besides the obvious of dragon training, of course.	Kis baare me hai ? Obvious dragon training ko chhod ke?
It is a coming to age story and has great friendship morals	Ye ek coming of age story  hai aur bahut acche friendship morals hai
Does the dragon talk?	Kya dragon baat kar sakte hai?
one of the best scenes is when the dragon Hiccup is attacked by the bad guy Night Fury and rather than killing him, he sets him free	Best scenes me se ek hai jab dragon Hiccup ko bad guy Night fury attack aur hai aur usne maarne k bajaye jaane deta hai
Yes, all of the dragons have some lines	Haan, sabhi dragon ki kuch lines hai.
So the dragon's name is Hiccup?	To dragon ka naam Hiccup hai?
Yes the two main dragons are named Hiccup and Night Fury	Haan, 2 main dragon hai Hiccup aur Night Fury
Okay, Night Fury freed Hiccup then?	Accha Night Fury Hiccup ko chhod deta hai phir
Yes, i guess it was the moral of the story.	Haan, I guess wahi tha story ka moral
Did the dragons breathe fire?	Kya Dragons fire breath karte hai?
Another important scene is when Hiccup's owner sees that Night Fury is hurt and can not fly. He makes him a prostectic wing and thats how he teaches him how to fly	ek aur mahatvapoorn drshy hai jab hichakee ke maalik ne dekha ki nait phyooree ko chot lagee hai aur vah ud nahin sakata hai. vah use ek prosthetik ving banaata hai aur vah use udane ka tareeka sikhaata hai
Im not too sure, but i bet they do. They probably only use it for good though since it is an animated movie aimed towards kids	mujhe yakeen nahin hai, lekin mujhe yakeen hai ki ve karate hain. ve shaayad keval achchhe ke lie isaka upayog karate hain, kyonki yah ek enimeted philm hai jisaka uddeshy bachchon kee or hai
Which part did Craig Ferguson give?	Craig Ferguson  ne kaun sa bhaag diya?
I would probably see this movie just because he is in it.  Do you think it's a good one to watch?	main shaayad yah philm sirph isalie dekhoonga kyonki vah isamen hai. kya aapako lagata hai ki yah dekhana achchha hai?
I meant to say, Which part did Craig Ferguson play?	mere kahane ka matalab hai, Craig Ferguson ne kaun sa bhaag khela?
He played Gobber the Belch, who was the training masters of the young warriors	unhonne gobar da belch kee bhoomika nibhaee, jo yuva yoddhaon ke prashikshan ke svaamee the
Were the warriors humans or dragons?	yoddha manushy the ya dregan?
well if you only like him then maybe no because his role is not a main role. If you like movies of the same genre then it may be a good fit.	yadi aap keval use pasand karate hain to shaayad nahin kyonki usakee bhoomika mukhy bhoomika nahin hai. agar aap ek hee jonar kee philmen pasand karate hain to yah ek achchhee phit ho sakatee hai.
It is a great movie to watch with children	bachchon ke saath dekhana ek behatareen philm hai
The warriors were humans, and they were mostly kids. They owned and trained the dragons	yoddha manushy the, aur ve jyaadaatar bachche the. ve dregan ke svaamitv aur prashikshit the
Do you like movies like this?	Apko aisi movie pasand hai?
I'm guessing that since the movie was aimed towards children that it had a happy ending?  Yes, I like some of them..  I don't go for a lot of singing in the animated movies though.  With the exception of the Wizard of Oz, that was a great movie, I could watch it over and over.	Mera anuman ha ki, jo movie balko ke liye banai jati hai, wo happy ending hai? Ha, Mujhe aisi pasand hai.. Mai animated movies me jyada gane ke sath me nahi hu. The Wizard of Oz ek achhi movie hai, mai use bar bar dekh sakta hu
Yes, it has a happy ending. Thats great, theres no singing in this film. I think this is a feel good film 	ha, wo happy ending wali hai. thats great, film me gane nahi hai. mujhe ye film achhi sunai padti hai
It had great reception and even has 2 sequels	Yas acchha reception tha aur usme keval 2 sequels hi the
Sounds like it.  I would probably like it.	acchi sunai padti he. Mujhe wo acchhi lagegi.
The fight scenes do tend to get kind of violent but they are very immerssoive	Fight scenes thode violent hai lekin woimmerssoive hai
Hi	hi
Hi.  It told me to read this page first so I'll be just a minute.	usna bola ki first page pado, to mai ek minute baad aayunga

The other person back out I am still here wasting my time so I hope that whoever checks this over is willing to pay me for holding up my end of the bargin.  Aborting conversation in a min if yall don't send me someone new to chat with.	dursa banda to chala gaya, mai abhi bhi hu, hope mujhe mera payment mile ga after bargain. mai 1 minute baad chat se nikal jayunga agar koi naya nahi aaya to.

Haha I guess that's true. I do prefer realism but I do appreciate that Disney throws in adult concepts in children's stories that go right over children's heads	Haaha mujhe lagata hai ki yah sach hai. Main realism ko pasand karata hoon lekin main appreciate karata hoon ki Disney bachchon kee kahaaniyon mein adult concepts dalta hai jo bachchon ke sir par seedhee jaata hain.

There can only be one neighborhood snowman, and that's Frosty! :O	keval ek pados snomain ho sakata hai, aur vah hai phrostee! : he

Toothless is my favorite dragon	Toothless mera favorite dragon hai
Toothless is a great character. Hiccup was supposed to kill him in the beginning but couldn't bring himself to do it and instead sets him free	Toothless ek great character hai. Hiccup asal me use maarne wala tha but mar nahi paya aur use free kar diya
He gradually tames the dragon and calls him toothless because of his retractable teech	Wo gradually dragon ko tame karta hai aur use toothless bulata hai kyuki uske retractable teeth hai
It was becuase of toothless that Hiccup learned how to tame other dragons	Toothless ki wajah se Hiccup baki dragons ko bhi tame karna seekh gaya
Do you think Hiccup cheats because of what he learns from Toothless ? (by using it his training class?)	Kya tumhe lagta hai hiccup cheat karta jo bhi toothless se seekha? ( apni training class me wo chez use karke?)
He become proficient in subduing the captive dragons, i don't know how much you can call that cheating	wo captive dragons ko vas karne me kushal ho gaya, uko aap cheating kaise keh sakte hai?
But he wouldn't have known that without having Toothless. 	Lekin wo ye Toothless ke bina nahi jan pata.
so maybe just an advantage not cheating 	to sayad wo advantage ho cheating nahi
How do you feel about how Stoick treats Hiccup?	Aapko kya lag raha he ki stoick Hiccup ke sath kya kar raha hai?
Stoick leaving Hiccup, but then arriving home unscucessful and finding how Hiccup had trained the dragons led to a celebration	stoick Hiccup ko chhod raha hai, lekin phir ghar mein becheni se pahuncha aur paaya ki Hiccup ne dragons ko kis tarah prashikshit kiya tha
i mean throughout the whole movie. he was rather harsh to him in the beginning	Mera matalab hai puri movie ke dauran. vah suruat mein usake prati kathor nahin tha
Stoick uses Hiccup when Hiccups accidently reveals that Toothless can locate the dragon's nest. Stoick disowns his son	Stoick Hiccup ka upayog karata hai jab Hiccups ko akasmik rup se pata chalata hai ki Toothless Dragon ke ghosle ka pata laga sakata hai. Stoick ne apane bete ko nanga kar diya
That to me is very harsh	Mere liye yah bahut harsh hai
However, when Hiccup almost drowns trying to free toothless, Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son	halaki, jab Hiccup lagabhag toothless ko chhudane ki koshish mein doob jata hai, to stoick apane bete ke saath un dono ko bacha leta hai
Did you like the ending? how they make Hiccup and Toothless basically equal? (both missing something vital?)	kya aapako ending pasand aaya? ve Hiccup aur Toothless ko mul rup se samaan kaise banate hain? (donon me kuchh vital yaad aa rahee hai?)
How do you feel about the rotten tomatoes 98% score?	kya rotten tomatoes ka score 98% sahi hei kya?
Yes, when Hiccup wakes up on Berk, his lower left leg is missing and he is using a prothesis, so he and toothless are the same	haan, jab Hiccup, Berk ke paas wakeup kiya tho uska Lower left leg miss hota aur usse prothesis ho jatha, tho uska daad bhi nahi rehatha.
I thought a 98% was a good score on rotton tomatoes	mein tho 98% laga, aur uska score tho kaafi ache hein rotten tomatoes ka
Hey	Hey
Hi	Hi
How’s it going?	Kaisa chal raha hai
Pretty good. Are you a Marvel fan?	Kaafi accha. Kya tum Marvel fan ho?
Good to hear. Sure, what about you?	Sunke accha laga. Sure, tum batao.
Yes, I am a huge Marvel fan. One of my favorites is the Avengers. Mark Ruffalo is great as The Hulk. 	Haan, main bahut bada Marvel fan hu. Avengers meri favorites me se hai. Mark Ruffallo bahut badhiya Hulk hai.
Sure, I liked the Avengers a lot.	Sure, Mujhe avengers bahut pasand aayi
I also think Ruffalo is a great Hulk.	Mujhe bhi lagta hai Ruffalo badhiya hulk hai.
Is Avengers the movie we’re supposed to talk about?	Kya Avengers wo movie hai jiske baare me ham baat karne wale hai?
Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92% rating and average of 8/10. Yes, I believe so. 	Rotten Tomatoes ne use 92% rating aur average 8/10 ka. Haan, yahi lagta hai
Okay then. Right, I’ve always experiened that IMDB gives movies a lower average rating than rotten tomatoes.	Okay phir. Mujhe yahi experience hua hai k IMDB Rotten Tomatoes se lower average rating deti hai
Tha	Tha
That's true	Haan sach hai
But I guess 92 and 80 are a fair assesment.	Lekin I guess 92 aur 80 fair assessment hai
Yeah, I think Joss Whedon was a good choice for director also. His vision was really inline with the comics. 	Haan, Mujhe lagta hai Joss Whedon director k liye acchi choice tha. Uski vision comics se milti hai
Well, I can’t speak for the comics (haven’t read them), but this movie is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories.	Well, main comics k baare me to nahi keh sakta ( nahi padha hu) but ye movie sabhi heroes aur unke stories ka badhiya mashup hai
I guess it’s just a very good movie with an amazing plot.	I guess ye ek acchi movie thi ek amazing plot k saath.
I agree. 	Main agree karta hu
Loki using Clint Barton to help him with the Tesseract was awesome too. I like him even though he's a bad guy	Taissairacht ke saath unakee madad karane ke lie loki ne klint baartan ka upayog kiya jo bahut hee bhayaanak tha. main use pasand karata hoon, bhale hee vah ek bura aadamee ho
Right, that was a great scene.	Sahee, vah ek behatareen drshy tha.
Loki’s a likable villain I’d say.	Loki ke ek yogy khalanaayak hai jo main kahata hoon
It was interesting how it caused such a riff within The Avengers. Thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie. 	Yah dilachasp tha ki avengers ke bheetar is tarah kee daraar kaise huee. thor ko ab bhee aisa lag raha tha ki philm ke dauraan unhonne lambe samay tak unake prati vaphaadaaree kee hai.
You think?	aapako lagata hai?
I thought he was pretty ruthless with him.	Mainne socha ki vah usake saath bahut kroor tha.
That’s just my opinion obviously.	Yah sirph meree raay hai.
I can see that somewhat but he could have done a lot more damage if he wanted to. 	Main dekh sakata hoon ki kuchh had tak agar vah chaahata to bahut adhik nukasaan kar sakata tha.
Do you have a specific example on mind?	Kya aapake paas man par ek vishisht udaaharan hai?
The end fight scene definitely was. He could have killed him. 	Antim phait seen jaroor tha. vah use maar sakata tha.
Oh, the one where Hulk ends up hitting him?	oh, wo jab hulk use maar raha tha?
Yeah, that was classic. One of the funniest moments of the movie. I also liked when Iron Man fell back through the wormhole. It had everyone on edge I think. 	haan, yah classic tha. Movie ke sabase funniest moments mein se ek. Mujhe wo bhee pasand aaya jab Iron Man wormhole ke maadhyam se vaapas gir gaya. Mujhe lagata hai ki yah har kisee ko yeh edge pe le aaya tha.
Absolutely. Epic scenes.	Sahi main. Pura epic scenes tha.
Can we talk about other movies or just this one?	kya ham koi bhi Movie ya sirph isi ke baare mein baat kar sakate hain ?
You know, MCU	aap jaanate hongain , MCU
I also like the way Nick Fury stood his ground with the Council. Just this one. 	mujhe yah bhee pasand hai ki jis tarah se Nick Fury ne Council ke saamne apana argument ko support karta raha. sirph yah ek.
Understood.	samajhe understood.
Yeah, Fury’s great too.	haan, Fury’s bhee great hai
So, any final thoughts?	to, koee bhee final thought.
It's crazy that the Council wanted him to drop a nuclear missile into New York. 	yah paagalpan hai ki Council chaahata tha ki vah nuclear missile New York mein girae
Great examples, man.	badhiya examples, man.
It was great talking to another MCU fan.	ek aur MCU fan se bath karke accha laga.
Take care now!	khayal rakho abhi!
Definitely! You too!	Definitely!tum bhi!

Sandra's friends in the movie criticize the actor, wondering why she would adopt a black kid. Very empowering	movie mein Sandra ke friends actor ko criticize karte hain, hairan hote huye ki wo black kid ko kyun adopt kar rahi hai. bohat empowering
Sandra goes against her friends wills, and keeps raising Micahel	Sandra apne friends ki will ke against jaati hai, aur Micahel ko raise karti rehti hai
That sounds like a really good message for our time when people are focusing on polarizing races.  It would make for a lot of good conversations with kids too.	ye kafi good message lagta hai hamare time ke liye jab log races ko polarize karne pe focus karte hain. ye kids mein bhi kafi achi conversation banega.
So does the movie have a lot of football in it?	to kya movie mein kafi footbal hai?
Not as much as you would think. Its about 25% football! A lot of the movie is about whats going on behind the scenes with his family issues	itna nahi jitna tum soch rahe hoge. ye 25% football ke baare mein hai! kafi movie is baare mein hai ki behind the scenes uske family issues mein kya chal raha hai

It's their nature and it's impossible	Wo unka nature hai aur wo impossible hai.

For this film at least I guess. It was pretty sad when Coulson died. Did that scene get you?	kam se kam is film k liye. Jab Coulson mara wo kaafi sad tha. Us scene me kuch laga tumhe?

It has some great reviews too.	kuch ache reviews bhi hein
I can't believe he ran away at a young age. Can't blame him though, it's hard to go through normal life when a family member is on drugs all the time	muje yakin hi nahi hota ki voh young age mein bhaag gaya. kuch blame bhi nahi kar sakthe kyon ki voh normal life apne family member ke saath ji bhi nahi sakthe, saare din drugs hi karthe they
Seems he had some good luck with some good people that helped him get into school and football.	haan yar kuch goodluck hota tho kaafi ache logon ke saath mil jaatha aur voh school jaatha aur voh football bhi kheltha
I agree. The two individuals that adopted him changed his life forever	mein maantha hoon. do individuals agar usse adopt nahi karthe tho uska life tho hamesha ke liye change hota/
Definitely, it also shows what kind of person he is by him withholding his strength at first	definitely, isse patha chaltha ki voh kaise tarah ka log hein jo uska strength pehla dekhayi detha
It is a shame that Leigh Anne's friends did not approve of what she was doing.	badi shame hey yar, jo leigh anne ka friends nei approve nahi kiya

It's crazy how he was approached by gang members when he went to go see his biological mother.	yeh tho crazy hein yar, jab voh apni biological mother ke paas approach kar rahe thi
It's good that he chose the right path though	acha tho voh yeh right path chose kiya hoga
That must have been a scary situation for him.	haan voh tho scary situation tha uskeliye
True, but it made him stronger of a person. It also most likely made him realize he didn't belong with the criminals especially after they were making sexual comments about the same person who was taking care of him	sach, isliye usse stronger ban saktha. usko realize bhi nahi huva ki voh yek criminals ke belong nahi hey aur jab koi sexual comments kare ise person ke baare mein  jo itna care karte
That is what probably made him decide that life was not for him. When someone talks that way about someone you love you know they are not your true friend.	ISSE KARAN US NE SOCH LIYA KI ZINDAHGI USKE LIYE NAHIN HAIN. AGAR KOI AISI BAAT KISI KE BARE ME JISE TUM PYAAR KARTHE HO  TO TUM MALUM HAIN KI YEH THMHARE SACHHA DOST NAHIN HAI

My favorite Spielberg movie is ET	meree pasandeeda speelabarg philm et hai
did Spielberg do the Indiana Jones?	kya speelabarg ne indiyaana jons kiya tha?
Yes, the whole series.Did you know Tom Selleck was supposed to be indiana jones?	haan, pooree shrrnkhala. kya aap jaanate hain ki tom selek ko indiyaana jon maana jaata tha?
i did not i wonder how that wouldve been.	mujhe aashchary nahin tha ki yah kaise hoga.
can you imagine Indiana Jones not been played by Harrison Ford??	kya aap soch sakate hain ki indiyaana jons hairisan phord dvaara nahin khela gaya tha ??
no i cant!	nahin, main nahin kar sakata!
harrison ford is legend!	hairisan phord kinvadantee hai!
Yes, but is hard to believe he only became famous at 35 years old because of star wars	haan, lekin yah vishvaas karana kathin hai ki vah keval staar vaars ke kaaran 35 varsh kee umr mein prasiddh ho gaya
what did you think about the indiana jones movie with the aliens?	aapane eliyans ke saath indiyaana jons philm ke baare mein kya socha?
The last one??? It did not have the same charm.	Last wali? Usme same charm nahi tha.
yes! i felt the same way very different i had mixed feelings about it	Haan! Mujhe bhi waise hi feel hua, kaafi mixed feelings thi us baare me
Harrison was too old to play the character.	Harrison bahut buddha hai us character k liye
Have you seen a good movie lately at the theaters?	Theatre me koi acchi movie dekha kya?
its been awhile since ive been to the movies 	kaafi time hogai koi movie nahi dekha
but i did watch the hateful 8	but maine hateful 8 dekhi thi
just recently for the first time	recently pehli baar k liye
it was really good	Kaafi sahi thi
Yes, that was a good one.I love Tarantino movies	Haan, badhiya thi, Mujhe Tarantino ki movies bahut pasand hai
time to say goodbye,nice talking to you	Goodbye kehne ka time aagaya, baat kaarke accha laga.
I hope that Morgan Freeman is actually G-d in reality, if there is one.	Mujhe lagta hai Morgan Freeman sach mein ek G-d hai, agar wahan hai to.
Yeah same here, looks like Rotten Tom atoes and Metacritic didn't score the movie very well...	Han mujhe bhi, Rotten Tomatoes aur Metacritic ki tarah lag rha hai movie to achhe se score nhi kiya...
I've never heard of CinemaScore but they seem to think highly of it	Maine CinemaScore ke baare mein sunna nhi lekin ve iske baare mein bahut sochte hai
I'm more familiar with Rotten Tomatoes. But they do say Jim Carrey is hilarious  in this movie 	Main Rotten Tomatoes ke saath zyada familiar huin. Lekin wo kehte hai Jim Carrey bahut hilarious hai iss movie mein
I've never heard of Lisa Ann Walter, but I assume she plays Jennifer Aniston's sister or mother in this. It doesn't say if they find out if he is G-d or not	Maine Lisa Ann Walter ke baare mein kabhi nhi suna, lekin mujhe lagta hai ki wo Jennifer Aniston ki sister ya mother ka role play kr rahi hai. Yahan nhi bataya gya wo G-d hai ya nhi.
Same here, never heard of the side characters. I have no idea who Philip Baker Hall is. He isn't sharing any simiar character last name so I'm guessing he might play a friend	yaah bhi, mein side characters ke baare mein kuch suna nahi. muje philip baker hall ka koi idea nahi. voh simiar character share kar raha hein uska last name tho uska friend neh play kiya hein
Do you know what it means to "get bogged down in treacle"? I don't know what to make of that review	kya aapko get bogged down in treacle ke baare mein kuch patha hein? muje uska review bhi nahi patha hein
I have no idea what that word means, but I'm assuming they are trying to say the movie lacked in substance or Carrey's acting ability? It seems the second review doesn't think Jim is a real actor "...Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor" Both reviews don't seem to like his acting skills....	muje kuch idea nahi hein, lekin carrey ka acting is movie me tho lacked hein. second reviews bhi itna acha nahi jo jim ne kiya voh ache actor hein.. carrey tho probably ache nursed hein dono ache actor future mein ban jaayenge. dono ka review kaafi ache skills hein
I'd still see it given the cast. Never heard of the director though	mein is director ke baare mein kuch suna nahi hein
Hello?	hello
Hello	Namste
Hello	Namste

I loved it but I'm so surprised by the ratings on it.	Muje accha lagta hai par me surprised hu uske rating se
Now is the 52% based on critic reviews or users?	critic reviews aur users ke base pe fifty two percent he?
I don't know. I thought everybody loved this movie lol!	mujhe nahi pata. I thought ye movie sabko pasand aayi lol
To me the older versions of themselves really struck a chord with me.	Mere liye unke older version really struck a chord with me
Maybe it wasn't as great based on its technical merits	Maybe technical merits pe wo itni acchi nahi thi
Sometimes movies can be enjoyable regardless	kabhi kabhi movies enjoyable ho sakti hai regardless
Possibly. To me it's just the perfect example of two lovers forever struggling to be together.	possibly. Mere liye ye do lovers ka sath hone k liye struggle ka perfect example hai.
Yup I agree with that	haan, main sehmet hu
Thats actually a great way to put it	actually ye bahut accha tareeka hai batane ka
Did you have a favorite scene?	Tumhara koi favorite scene hai?
The older versions of themselves was just the most touching part of this movie. Till the end they stayed together even when she no longer knew who he was. It's just so touching.	Unke older versions is movie ka sabse touching part tha. Wo end tak sath rahe even jab usko pata nahi tha wo kaun thi. Ye bahut touching tha
Yeah, it was so sad at how alzheimers just eats away at your memory like that. 	haan, ye bahut sad hai alzheimers kaise tumhari memory kha jata hai.
I don't have a favorite lol. I just loved this movie as a whole. Some parts and scenes were more touching than others but it's just an overall love for the entire movie.	mera koi favorite nahi he, lol. mujhe to bas whole movie se love he. kuch parts aur scenes others se adhik touching the but ye overall love he entire movie ke liye.
Yes it is.	yes bilkul he.
I can't imagine losing my counterpart like that.	me apne counterpart ka is tarah se khona imagine bhi nahi kar sakti
I can't believe that its been out for 14 years though! I saw it at the theaters too lol	me believe nahi kar sakta ki ye 14 sal ke liye outside raha he! Although mene ise theaters me bhi dekha he, lol
Me either! I dont know which is worse, having somebody die completely, or just their memory	Mene either! me nahi janata kon sa worse he, kisi ka completely mar jana ya just unki memory ka mar jana.
Yeah it's been a long time since I saw it but I still remember it like it was yesterday lol	yeah, kafi long time ho gaya he ise dekhe but ye mujhe still ease remember he like yesterday hi dekha tha, lol.
I know!	mujhe information he!
Yeah, really makes me think. 	yeah,  really mujhe ye sochne par badhya karta he.
It does. 	ha it does badhya
Now I have the urge to watch it again lol	now mujhe urge he ise again watch karne ki, lol.
Good thing I still have it on DVD	good bat ye he ki ye mere pas still ,dvd me he
I've always hated the way parents intercepted relationships the way Anne did. Keeping people apart based on money.	Jis tarah se parents ne  intercepted relationship isse mujhe always hate thi , Anne ne jis tarah se kiya.Money ke basis par people ko apart rakhna.
I'll wait until the wifey gets home though.. that should get me out of the dog house :)	me wait karoonga wifey ki home return hone tak..ye sambhvta mujhe dog house se bahar rakhe:)
Lol. I'd love to see it again myself.	Lol.me myself ise dekhna pasand karu.
Jim Carrey is a great actor that has had a lot of major roles in movies. What is your favorite movie with Jim Carrey?	Jim Carrey badhiya actor hai aur bahut movies me major role kiya hai. Tumhari jim carrey ki favorite movie kaunsi hai
I enjoyed Liar Liar the most. He has a lot of good movies though. What did you like about Bruce Almighty?	Mujhe Liar Liar sabse jyada pasand aayi. Uski waise to bahut acchi movies hai. Bruce Almighty kaise lagi?
I enjoyed that Bruce Almighty was a comedy because I enjoy a good laugh. I also liked how the movie introduced God, which not many movies do. What did you like most about Bruce Almighty?	Muujhe Bruce Almighty acchi lagi kyuki wo comedy thi aur mujhe comedy pasand hai. Mujhe ye bhi accha laga kaise usme god aya jo ki sab movies me nahi ata. Tumhe Bruce almighty me sabse jyada accha kya laga?
Do you think that the movie deserves the rating that it received?	Kya tumhe lagta hai ki film uss rating ko deserve krta hai jo usko mili thi?
Yes I liked the role of Morgan Freeman as "God" also. I also like the setting of the movie which is memorable to me because Im from Buffalo. 	Han mujhe "God" ke role mein Morgan Freeman ka character bahut pasand aaya. Mujhe film ki setting bhi pasand hai jo mere liye yaadgaar hai kyunki Im buffalo se.
I think it was rated pretty low. What score would you have given it?	Mujhe lagta hai iski rating bahut low hui hai. Kya score diya hai tumne ise?
Oh that is interesting! Morgan Freeman is another great actor. His voice can be used in many settings and roles. 	Oh yeh to intresting hai! Morgan Freeman bhi ek or achha actor hai. Uski awaaz bahut si settings and roles mein use ki jaa skti hai.
I think that it should have been rated higher. It seems like rotten tomatoes always gives low ratings though.	Mujhe lagta hai ki iski rating zyada honi chahiye thi. Haanlanki rotten tomatoes hamesha kam rating deta hai.
Wasn't there a sequel to this movie?	Kya iss movie ka koi sequel hai?
Do you feel like this movie was a breakout movie for Jim Carrey?	Kya tumhe lagta hai ki yeh movie Jim Carrey ke liye breakout tha?
Im not 100% sure. But it did have like an open end to the movie	Main 100% sure nhi huin. But ye ek open end ki tarah tha iss movie ke liye
I think that he has a lot of recognition for being in this movie. But I am not sure of other movies he was in before this one. 	Mujhe lagta hai iss movie mein bane rehne ke liye uske bahut pehnchaan hai. But main sure nhi huin ki isse pehle dusri movies kaisa tha.
I think Ace Ventura and the Mask may have come out before this. Not sure 	Mujhe lagta hai ki isse pehle Ace Ventura and the Mask bahar aa gye honge. Sure nhi huin
I also enjoyed him in the Grinch movie. He is able to perform many different roles across many genres of movies. 	muje grinch movie pasand hein. voh kaafi role mein perform karthe
Has he played any serious movie roles like a drama? 	kya kuch serious movie yaani drama me bhi play keye hein kya?
I am not sure about that. He seems to be more of a comedian type actor. 	muje patha nahi hein. lekin voh comedian type ka actor hein
Do you know any other movies by this director?	kya aap ko is director ka aur koi movies patha hein?
If you were in a similar situation as Bruce (like in the key scene mentioned), would you feel frustrated as well?	tho Bruce yaani keyscene ke tarah lag raha hein. kya aapko thoda frustrated feel hota hein
I have not heard of any other movies by this director. 	mein is director ke baare mein kuch nahi suna hein
Yes I think his frustrations are very relatable in many aspects of life	haan. thoda frustrations hoon lekin is life mein kuch aspects relate bhi kar saktha
I agree. I would feel the same way if I were constantly experiencing bad luck	mein maantha hoon. muje bhi kuch aise hi feel huva, sabhi is bad luck ko experiencing karthe hein
Would you want to play "God" for a week? What would you do?	kya is week ko God movie play dekhna pasand karenge? ya aur kuch?
I probably wouldn't, only because that would be a lot of responsibility to take care of everything in the entire world. But I would like to eliminate suffering in people. What about you?	nahi yar, kyon ki muje aur koi kaam hein, kyon ki kaafi logon isse suffer hote hein. aapka kya haal chaal hein?
Same here. I would probably end up like Bruce and end up saying yes to everyones prayers since it would be so overwhelming	muje bhi.. mein tho bruce ke saath end up karunga kyon ki voh sabhi prayers ko suntha aur sabhi overwhelming ho jaathe
Do you think that was the best way for him to answer prayers through email?	kya is tarah ka prayers aap maanthe hon, jaise email mein prayer send karna?
I agree. I think the email system was less personal than how God would actually answer prayers in reality. However, at that point I'm sure he was overwhelmed. How would you answer everyone's prayers if you had to be God?	haan,... ab sabhi update hogaye tho kyon God bhi apne email system se kyon nahi chaleye... however, voh tho badi overwhelmed they.. kya voh saari prayers sunthe, jaise God ke tarah?
Maybe through some type of app which is more modern now.  Do you think Bruce and Grace made a good couple?	hosaktha, ab sabhi mordern tho hein... kuch app bhi ho saktha.. kya bruce aur grace vaakahi mein ache couple the?
I think that the fact that they came back together and reconciled proves that they were always meant to be together. 	haan voh dono apne aapas ka pyar ko proves karthey they..
What do you think he learned the most about being God for the week?	aapko kya lagtha hein ki voh God se kya sikha hoga ?
I think he learned about true happiness and how much people need prayers and responses by God. I think that he now understands that importance of not complaining. 	muje lagtha hein ki, voh true happiness kya  hota aur kaise peoples prayer karthe aur god kaise respond karteh.. ab usses sab understand hoga ..
Jaws was such a good movie!	Jaws kya good movie thi!
I agree. It was well made.	me agree karta hu. yah well made thi.
The scares were well timed.	scares well timed the
I liked the soundtrack.	mene soundtrack like kiya
What was your favorite part?	tumhara favorite part kon sa tha?
I think it was utilizing a location like Amity Island. It made me feel as if the plot could happen anywhere.	mujhe lagta he yah Amity Island jaisa location use kar raha he.mujhe aisa lagata he jaise plot kahi bhi ho sakta he.
Was the soundtrack your favorite part?	kya soundtrack tumhara favorite part tha?
That makes sense. Yes, especially the part that it is so famous for. The sound they played whenever they wanted to increase the audience's fear and anxiety.	isme sense he. ha, especially voh part jiske liye ye itna famous he.jab bhi ve audience ki fear aur anxiety badana chahte the unhone ye sound play kiya.
Just another affirmation that Spielberg knew what he was doing even in post-production.	ek dusra affirmation ki Spielberg knew ki voh post-production me kya kar raha tha.
Do you usually like this type of movie?	kya aap aamataur par is tarah kee philm pasand karate hain?
No doubt. He is very good at making movies. No, it is not my favorite kind. I am not much into jump scares. I like documentaries. How about you?	isamen koee shak nahin, vah philmen banaane mein bahut achchhe hain. nahin, yah meree pasandeeda kism nahin hai. main bahut jyaada dara hua nahin hoon. mujhe vrttachitr pasand hain. aap kaise hain?
I like this type of movie around Halloween; otherwise, I enjoy action films.	mujhe hailoveen ke aasapaas is tarah kee philm pasand hai; anyatha, mujhe ekshan philmon ka aanand milata hai
That is understandable. Halloween is a good time to scare yourself. 	yah samajh mein aata hai.hailoveen khud ko daraane ka ek achchha samay hai.
What did you think of the mayor's reaction to the shark attack?	shaark ke hamale par meyar kee pratikriya ke baare mein aapane kya socha?
I think it was greedy. I agree it is best not to panic the public, but putting people in danger out of greed is not okay.	mujhe lagata hai ki yah laalachee tha.main maanata hoon ki janata ko ghabaraana nahin chaahie, lekin laalach se logon ko khatare mein daalana theek nahin hai.
Exactly, I thought it was neat to think of real world implications both fiscally and morally.	theek, mainne socha tha ki vaastavik duniya ke nihitaarth ko naitik aur naitik roop se donon ke baare mein sochana saaph tha.
Of how to present this to the public.	ise janata ke saamane kaise pesh kiya jae.
Which in the end resulted in a shark-hunting frenzy	jisake parinaamasvaroop ant mein ek shaark-shikaar unmaad paida hua
I like to think of those things too. I did not like that part. I think I would have liked it better if the shark was led out to sea, but most people would probably not enjoy a movie like that, not enough drama.	un cheejon ke baare mein bhee sochana pasand karate hain.mujhe vah hissa pasand nahin tha.mujhe lagata hai ki shaark ko samudr tak le jaaya jaata to mujhe achchha lagata, lekin jyaadaatar log shaayad us tarah kee philm ka aanand nahin lenge, paryaapt naatak nahin
You are right on that.	aap us par sahee hain.
It was nice to see characters such as Brody step up - though it took his son to go into shock in order to spur him to action.	brodee ke kadam jaise charitron ko dekhana achchha tha - haalaanki isane unake bete ko kaarravaee ke lie prerit karane ke lie sadame mein le liya.
I think Spielberg hit the nail on the head as far as portraying small town politics.	mujhe lagata hai ki speelabarg ne chhote shahar kee raajaneeti ko chitrit karane ke lie naakhoon par sir maara.
Yes. It was realistic, though I think much of it applies to politics of all types. 	haan. yah yathaarthavaadee tha, haalaanki mujhe lagata hai ki yah sabhee prakaar kee raajaneeti par laagoo hota hai.
Money seems to always be highest priority.	paisa hamesha sarvochch praathamikata lagata hai.
Unfortunately, true.	durbhaagyavash yah sach hai.
And sadly we do not get galvanized to action sometimes until tragedy strikes.	aur dukh kee baat yah hai ki hamen traasadee ke hamalon tak kabhee-kabhee kaarravaee ke lie jastee nahin milata hai.
Have you seen other Spielberg movies?	kya aapane any speelabarg philmen dekhee hain?
Yes, he has his shining moments and some duds along the way. I feel that more of his movies fall into the former rather than latter category.	haan, usake paas apane chamakadaar kshan aur raaste mein kuchh yugal hain. mujhe lagata hai ki unakee adhik philmen baad kee shrenee ke bajaay poorv mein aatee hain.
You?	aap?
I know I have and that his movies are usually really well made, but I cannot remember which movies are his. I am very bad at stuff like that.	hey muje toh unka  movies bahut pasand hein lakin unka movies muje yaad nahi aatha hein. mein yaad karne me thoda kamjor hoon
I did not like the scuba part. I enjoy enjoy breathing .	muje toh voh scuba part bilkul pasand nahi hein, magar voh breathing toh mein enjoy kar raha tha
 I usually am as well.	mein tho aise hi hoon
Sorry, for the typo.	maaf kar na us typo ko
No worries. Completely agree on breathing/ I would not be getting in the water even with a cage.	jaane de yar, mein toh us breathing ko completely agree karunga, aur mein kabhi bhi us cage mein pani mein nahi jaavunga
Well, thanks for sharing this conversation with me. It seems that our time has come to an end. I hope you have a wonderful morning, afternoon, night wherever you are.	acha, aapse baath karne mein bahut dhanyavad. muje lagtha hein ki hamara time ab khatma ho raha hein, aapka din acha rahane ka mera subh kamna
You as well.	aapko bhi
Hi! I've really enjoyed the movie "Real Steel" It was a great movie that was full of adventure!	hi! muje Real steel ka movie tho enjoy kartha aur voh movie tho pura adventure hein
I've seen this one before	mein pehele hi yeh dekha hoon
seems kinda like a typical family-action film with some scifi elements	typical family action ka film ke tarah lag raha hein kuch scifi elements
was kinda cool tho	kuch cool hein
Yes it is sort of the family type of film. But I got very much into the characters especially Hugh Jackman's.	han, is film kuch family type ka hein.. lekin muje is characters jo especially hugh jakman se bahut impress hein
was interesting to see Hugh play a more domestic role 	hugh ko dekhne ka bahut interesting hein jo domestic role play karte
normally he's always a loner fighter type	normally, voh lone fighter type ke hein
Yes but  he played it well and was able to pull it off.	haan, lekin voh ache play kiye hein aur pull it off karne ka able hein
yeah he played the struggle of the character well	haan, voh us character ko struggle karke play kiya hein
I always find it interesting to see what sort of demands actors can get into. I think he fit in with everyone else really well.	Maine hamesha yeh interesting paya ki actors kis type ka demands kar sakte hai. Mujhe lagta hai wo sab ke sath thik se fit hai.
yeah the unusual mix of actors led to a coherent mixture 	yeh hai ek unusual mix actors ka jo bana ek coherent mixture.
That's definitley true.	Yeh definitley true hai.
I enjoyed seeing all of the different robot fighters in the movie s well.	Mujhe different type ke robot fighters movie me dekhne me pasand aye.
the new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an everyday thing in the movie's world	Naye paragraph se mujhe robot ke interesting factor ka pata chala is movie world ke.
like he's just a lower-class dude but he owns a fighting robot	Woh ek lower-class ladka hai par uske paas ek fighting robot hai.
Yeah seeing the draw of their world and how these robots are just sort of common was something that I really liked as well.	Yeh dikh raha hai kaise woh world se draw hue hai aur kaise ye robots sirf ek common chiz hai jo mujhe pasand bhi hai.
I thought about what it would be like to really live in that world	Main ne socha ki kis tarah us world me jiya jata hoga.
also interesting how it brings up the point that improved technology doesn't make all problems go away	yeh kaafi interesting point ubharta hai ki improved technology se problems gaye nahi hain.
this guy still is in debt and so on	Ye ladka abhi bhi debt me hai and rahega.
Yes no matter what we have basic life issues will never really change. They'll just come about in a new way.	KUCH BHI HO, LEKIN LIFE ISSUES KO KABHI CHANGE NAHI HOTE.. VOH KAHI NEW WAY MEIN AA HI JAATHA
that was a pretty good scene (the new paragraph)	KAAFI ACHE SCENE HEIN IS NEW PARAGRAPH MEIN
kind of hinted at things remaining worse for the guy/son but eventually they fought their way back	HINT KE TARAH HEIN, KUCH GUY KA YAAD AATHA JO EVENTUALLY AAPAS MEIN FOUGHT KIYE THE
cool to see the human spirit reflected in robots	COOL HE US ROBOTS KO HUMAN SPIRIT SE DEKHNE KA
Oh yeah lol I remember that...	HAAN YAR, MUJE BHI YAAD HEIN
It's just the classic underdog story told in a somewhat different way. There will always be trials and triumphs	YEH THO CLASSIC UNDERDOG STORY JO DIFFERENT WAY MEIN KAHA GAYA HEIN.. TRIALS AUR TRIUMPHS THO AATHE JAATHE HEIN
As long as humans are around we'll never really intrinsically change .	JAB TAK HUMANS AAPAS MEIN AATHE TAB TAK HUM KABHI INTRINSICALLY CHANGE NAHI KARTE
yeah the robots don't change the human life, they just augment it	HAAN, ROBOTS THO HUMAN LIFE KO NAHI CHANGE KARTE, YEH SIRF AUGMENT HI HEY
nothing intrinsic is lost	INTRINSIC THO KUCH NAHI HEIN
Right. I suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans - more so than the actual humans. That's a really  interesting concept, I think.	SAHI HEI, KAHI LOG THO ROBOTS KO HUMAN KE TARAH DEKHNE LAGTHE LEKIN ACTUAL HUMANS THO BEHETAR HEIN.. REALLY INTERESTING CONCEPT HEIN YAR
kinda reminds me of virtual reality	virtual reality ka yaad aaya
humanity lives on but through the robots	humanity tho jinda rahega, lekin robots
even though the robots are doing the action their action is still fully human	robots kitna bhi kaam karega, lekin lagtha tho human ki tarah hi
Yeah that's very true. I would love it if someday we could really have virtual reality like that. It would be so much fun to be able to really feel like you're a super hero!	haan voh tho sach hein... ab tho nahi lekin jarur yek din muje pasand aayaga.. super hero ke tarah feel karna tho fun hein
yeah, you'd have the thrill of a suernatural existence without losing your humanity	haan, kya aapko supernatural existence ka thrill hein, humanity ko lose kare bina
i think that's a nice message the film has	muje lagtha hein ki, yeh ache message hein is film ka
Right that is very true. We're all interconnected in this world somehow. Even if some people do have  more than others.	haan. sabhi is world ko interconnected hein.. even kuch people dusron ke saath
I didn't know Billy Crystal was the voice of Mike but I love it!	mujhe nahi pata tha Billy Crystal Mike ka voice tha par mujhe ye acha laga!
Steve  Buscemi is in this too?	isme Steve Buscem bhi hai?
Yes he is! I'm guessing you've seen Monsters University?	Han wo hai! Main guess kar raha hun tumne Monsters University dekhi hai
I did when it came out years ago, just never thought to look at the voice acting.	maine dekhi jab ye saalon pehle ayi thi, just kabhi voice acting ki taraf dekhne ka nahi socha
When did you see it?	tumne ye kab dekhi?

yeah but it was not a logical story	Han but ye ek logical story nhi thi
nobody have a vengeance for their puppy got killed	Kisi ne bhi puppy ke maare jane ka badla nhi liya.
do you watch the climax	Kya tumne climax dekha
It is what they call neo-noir.  I guess that means it is not supposed to make sense because it is an altered reality.	ise voh Neo-noir call karte he. mujhe lagta he that means , iska koi sense nahi he because ye ek altered reality he.
Yes I watched the whole movie.	yes mene whole movie dekhi.

Batman intercepts a drug shipment, provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone, and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of the few honest cops left in Gotham, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets with Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare  him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane (which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the  word "Scarecrow"), and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating "the Scarecrow", Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply.

A big sigh of relief...kind of like Titanic.  They do eventually get rescued...although not all of them:)	A big sigh of relief... kuch kuch Titanic jaisa. Aakhir mein wo rescue ho jaate hain ... although sab nahi bach paate hain :)
it has war scenes or only posrwar scenes	usme war scenes hain ya only posrwar scenes hain
War scenes...more like just following these guys and their experiences and what people would do to escape (assume dead, pretend to be from another country)	War scenes ... wo un logon ko follow karna aur unke experiences ke baare mein jyada hai aur log escape karne ke liye kya kya karenge (assume dead, pretend to be from another country)
Civilians are sent to rescue most of them on family owned fishing vessels.	Jyadatar ko rescue karne ke civilians ko bheja gaya family owned fishing vessels par.

It's definitely a good coming of age movie. The boy has to become a man by killing a dragon, but he becomes friends with the dragon and doesnt want to kill it	Ye definitely ek acchi coming of age movie hai. Dragon ko maar ke ladke ko mard banna hai but wo dragon ka friend ban jata hai aur usse maarna nahi chahta hai.
Cool, sounds like an interesting story.	Cool, interesting story sound karti hai.
They were definitely trying to promote a message of not being blindly forced into a way of life/culture, just because the older men thought that way	Wo definitely ek way of life/ culture me blindly force na hone ka message promote kar rahe the, just becasuse older aadmi aise sochte  hai.

It wasn't your typical Disney live-action, but it is due to this that it was great. definitely surpassed the ideas seen in Frozen.	haan main dekha aur mujhe achha laga. yeh  disney live-action movie jaise nahin hain, us ke karan yeh movie bahut achhi hain. frozen se bhi bahut achha movie hain

Well sleeping beauty its an old movie bud really good	Khair sleeping beauty ek purani movie hai but bahut achhi hai
I think the new ones are excellent as well	Mujhe lagta hai new ones bhi bahut badiya hai
So very true. I just like the digital look of the fairytale setting that plays off the original animated scenery.	Bilkul sahi. Mujhe fairytale setting ka digital look pasand hai jo original animated scenery dikhata hai.
Are you a fan lf disney movies?	Kya tum disney movies ke fan ho?
This movie did cause me to loathe King stefan though... I mean he tore her wings off.	Iss movie ne raja stefan ko kam karne ke liye kiya... Mera matlab usne apne wings kaat diye.
I like pirates of the Caribbean more than all the other Disney'	Mujhe pirates of the Caribbean sabhi Disney' movies se zyada pasand hai
Yes and No. I find that the animated films are quite nostalgic, but the live-action films like Maleficent in which you see the darkness behind the films cater better to me nowawdays.	Han ye nhi. Mujhe lagta hai ki animated movies bahut nostalgic hoti hai, lekin live-action movies jaise Maleficent jis mein tum film ke peechhe andhera dekh skte ho ajakl zyada behtar hai mere.
True i think you are a good movie reader	Sach mujhe lagta hai ki tum ek achhe movie reader ho
Though I do find the Jerry Burckheimer productions better than Robert Stromberg who did Maleficent 	Halanki mujhe Jerry Burckheimer productions better lagti hai Robert Stromberg jisne Maleficent banayi thi
Yes you are correct 	Han tum sahi ho
But Maleficent has a far more heartbreaking background than the Pirates movies.the background of Maleficent, and even the fact taht she cared for Aurora despite her villian status makes her likeable and hateable at the same time	But Maleficent ka background zyada heartbreaking and pirate movies se. Maleficient ka background, aur ye fact ki wo Aurora ki care krti hai jabki uska ek villan ka status hote hue bhi use likeable or hateable dono ek hi samay pe banata hai
Which ones are your favorite movies animated or action 	Tumhari konsi movies favorite hai animated ya action
How many times have you seen this movie	Tumne yeh movie kitni baar dekhi hai
I quite have not seen the whole movie	Maine yeh saari movie nhi dekhi
I like the action ones best I think. and ive only seen Maleficent once.... while the storyline was great, I am not complelled to watch it again. 	Mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe action sabse achhi lagti hai. aur maine sirf ek baar Maleficent dekhi hai... jabki storyline bahut achhi thi, main isse phir se nhi dekhna chahta
Yes me too 	Han main bhi
what parts have you seen	Tumne konse parts dekhe hai
To be honest i dont really remember much	Sach kahu to mujhe zyada yaad nhi hai
I mean I do give them credit for the live-action of the whole Phillip rescuing Aurora from Maleficent thing, but even with computers and the live-action, none of it did justice to the animated version where she turns into the dragon	Mera matlab hai ki main use pure Philip ki live-action ke liye credit deta huin, jo ki sirf Maleficient ki cheezon se Aurora ko bachate hain, but yahan tak ki computers aur live-action ke saath, in mein se kisi ne bhi animated version ke saath justice nhi ki, jahan wo dragon mein badal jati hai
plus they added a darker element where King Stefan also falls to his death	unhone uske upar kala element add kiya uske vajahse raja stefan mar gaya
Well i do remember that part	ha mujhe wo part yad hai
Are you into movies critics 	tum movie crtics ho kya
I find this movie confuses me lol. You're happy she gets her wings back, but mad Aurora's dad died... or is that good too? He wasn't bad in the animated version.	mujhe ye movie confuse krti hai. tum khush ki usko wings milte hai, but paga aurora ke dad marte hai.. ya ye bhi acha hai? wo bura nahi hai animated movie me

Lol	has raha hu jorse
Have you seen this movie?	aap movie dekha hai?
I just saw it.	ha ,maine abi kuch der pahale dekha hoon.
Have you seen it?	aap dekha hai?
No, I usually like stuff with Benedict Cumberpatch though.	nahi,main Benedict cumberpatch jaise movie  dekhtha hoon
It was such a thrilling movie. Based on the life of Alan Turing.	woh bada romanchakari movie tha.woh Alan Turing  ke jeevan ke bare me tha
Keira Knightly slightly annoys me however.	Keira Knightly mujeh achi nahi lagtha
Cumberbach was really the highlight of the film	Cumberbach film ke mukhya akarshan tha .
Got good reviews, Rotten tomatoes rarely goes over 90% it seems.	acha sameekhan mila , rotton tomatos ko 90% ke uper sameekshan nahi mila
Who is Alan Turing?	Alan Turing Kaun Hai
true. Metacritic gave them 73/100. Turing was a mathematician who was a cryptanalyst for the British during WWII against the Germans. He is famous for breaking the Enigma code.	sach hein yar, metacritic ne 73/100 diya tha. Turing toh mathematician hein jo british ke liye cryptanalyst  bane the tab wwii saari germans ke against the. aur voh enigma code ko break karne mein famous hein.
He was outed as a spy by the police who were investigating a break in at his home.	voh toh spy the aur police ke liye investigate kar rahe the, jo unka ghar break hogaya tha
Definitely see it if you get a chance.	jarur dekh na agar aapko chance mila toh
Dramas tend to kind of bore me usually, with many note-worthy exceptions. I like Comedies mostly or fantasy, Sci-fi. I will check it out though, all in all i just love movies!	voh drama toh bore lagne laga usme jyada note worthy exceptions tha. muje comedies aur fantasy pasand aaya especially sci-fi. mein check kar lunga, overall muje movies pasand hein
Sounds like an interesting fellow, will definetly give it a watch.	lagtha hein interest se rahega, jarur mein watch karunga
It is really more of an espionage movie. It is pretty exciting. I guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with Morcom, his mentor.	han yar yeh toh espionage movie nikla. bahut excite hein usme. muje lagtha hein ki usme kuch drama apni boarding school ka experiences mein se likha hoga aur morcom mein padne se likha hoga jo uska mentor tha
I think you will enjoy it.	muje laga ki tu enjoy karega
Morton Tyldum is a great director.	morton tyldum bahut badiya director hein
Andrew grant and that rag science news never gets it right, if he liked it i will probably hate it.	voh andrew grant aur uska rag science ka news kabhi bhi right nahi hota, agar voh ushe pasand aaya tho mein use hate karunga
The hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of Cumberpatch as i am.	voh hollywood reporter toh cumberpatch nikhla, jaisa mein hoon.
It is kind of technical. It goes pretty in depth about his machine to break the code. He has some breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows. You will probably enjoy that.	ye technical type ka hai, code break karne ke liye machine me bahut deep jana padta hai. use ek breakthrough milta hai jab use ye realize hota hai ki wo use pahle se malulm words se wo is program kar sakta hai. tum enjoy karoge ise.
Cumberbach does a great job acting.	kamal ki acting ki hai Cumberbach ne.
These storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it interesting that it kinda distorts history in my opinion.	mere opinion me true stories pe based ye story hamesha history ko distort karti hain use interesting banane ke liye.
The bit about getting married to Keira Knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting. I might warn you about all that.	Keira Knightley se marriage ko lekar jo wakya hai, wo thoda annoying hai agar aap uski acting ko leke thode favorable nahi hai to. tumhe iske bare me warn kar raha hu.
It is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life. I see your point there.	interesting baat ye hai ki yah movie us play par based hai, jo uski life par likhi book par based hai. tumhara point dekh sakta hu mai.
I would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film, the good acting, and even the half made up story!	mai probably film ke technical aspect ko enjoy karu, badhiya acting, aur half cooked story.
I think also where it is a movie about a mathematician, it kind of helps to add in some plot elements. I think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting.	I think also yah movie ek mathematician ke baare men hai, plot me thode elements dalna helpful hai. par mujhe ye unusual laga kyonki uski life to waise hi itni interesting hai.
There is quite a bit of espionage involved as well. I suppose I am not spoiling it since it is history, but there is some Russian collusion involved.	isme espionage ka angle bhi involve hai. I suppose mai  kuch spoil nahi kar raha hu kyonki ye history hai, but kuch Russian secret bhi involved hai.
If he marries Keira knightly i may be shouting at my T.V.	agar wo Keira knightly se marriage karega to mai shayad T.V. par hi shout karne lagu.
Big drama when Turing confronts the russians.	bada drama hua jab Turning Russians ko confront karta hai.
Yeah you might have to fast forward through the lurid romance. It is not so bad though.	haan, aapako phurteela romaans ke maadhyam se aage badhana hoga. yah haalaanki itana bura nahin hai.
She is trite, absolutely, but the director does make it work here.	vah bilkul trait hai, lekin nirdeshak ise yahaan kaam karate hain.
also, turns out he is gay!	yah bhee pata chala ki vah samalaingik hai!
so she gets what she deserves.	isalie use vah milata hai jisaka vah hakadaar hai.
you might actualy like it.	aap ise pasand kar sakate hain.
I didn't really get that part, but who can understand the gays?	mujhe vaastav mein vah hissa nahin mila, lekin samalaingikon ko kaun samajh sakata hai?
Well, that kinda of makes it more inviting to me, Keira Nightly must be sad to find that out!	khair, yah thode ise aur adhik mere lie aamantrit karata hai, keira naitalee ko yah pata lagaane ke lie dukhee hona chaahie!
yeah I think she was pretty upset. Like I said I didn't really understand all of that. I was mostly in it for the math. What an interesting, fascinating story.	haan, mujhe lagata hai ki vah bahut pareshaan thee. jaisa mainne kaha ki main vaastav mein us sab ko samajh nahin paaya hoon. main jyaadaatar ganit ke lie isamen tha. kya dilachasp, aakarshak kahaanee hai.
I think Turing was gay for his mentor or something, but he dies.	mujhe lagata hai ki tyooring apane guru ya kuchh aur ke lie samalaingik tha, lekin vah mar jaata hai.
Sounds a bit like Beautiful mind that was a great movie, too!	sundar dimaag kee tarah lagata hai ki ek mahaan philm thee, bhee!
Tuberculosis.	Tuberculosis.
Yeah I did love Beautiful mind. I read that that guy actually was working for the government.	Haan Beautiful mind accha laga.maine padha hai woh government main kaam karta tha.
Talk about changing the story!	story badalne ke baare main batao!
Turing's story is pretty sad. He got bullied a lot at boarding school. Seems to have affected him a lot. Too bad he wasn't able to find love. Maybe he should have gone for somebody besides Kiera Knightley!	Turing ki story bahut sad hai. usko boarding school main bahut bully kia gaya.Lagta hai woh bahut affect hua. Too bad use love nahin mila. Maybe use Kiera Knightley ke alava kisi aur ko jaana chahiye tha!
How come you dislike her so much?	kaise tum use itna dislike kar sakte ho?
Is it because you guys used to date?	kya isliye ki tum log dating karte the?
Mostly just for hogging that driftwood in Titanic ;)	Mostly driftwood ke hogging ke liye Titanic mein:)
Oh yeah. I have never seen that one. 	Oh haan. Maine kabhi nahin dekha tha usko.
I find her Wiry, trite, and egotistical. I only enjoy those qualities in myself.	mujhe woh Wiry,trite aur egotistical laga. Mujhe sirf who qualities apne mein lagta hai.
I know there is that song by celine dion.	mujhe malum hai woh song celine dion se hai.
haha that is funny. I figured that but didn't want to say.	Ha Bahut hi majedar hai. Hum ko malum tha ki bat karna nahi chahete
She is kind of a walking plattitude. Kind of like Reese Witherspoon, but more indiana less texas	Woh ladki chalne wali sadharan hai. Reese Witherspoon ki tarah, lekin jyada indiana aur kum Texas
or something	ya kuch kuch
Oh, its ok. Im not blind. However after looking at Keira Knightley for 2 hours i might be.	Arey teek hai. Hum andha nahi hai. Lekin do ghante tak hum Keira Knightly ko dekhne ke badh,  ho sakta hai
Still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told, ill have to tune in.	Phir bhi is kahani aisa mahatwa lagta hai ki sabhi ko batana chahiye. Humko sunna padega.
anyways she didn't ruin the movie. If anything, Turing's life ruins the movie. It's just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love. He could have just worked out, made some friends, and been happy. It is a very important story. Reminds me of the life of Charles Darwin, or Plato.	Vise bhi usne philam ko barbad nahi kiya. Turing ka jeevan film ko barbad kar deta hai. Bahut dukh ki bat hai ki voh tung agaya aur sam legik prem ka sharan leta hai. Woh kam kar sakta tha, kuch dost bana sakta tha, aur khush reha sakta tha. Yeh to ek bahut hi mahatpurna kahani hai. Charles Darwin ya Plato ka yad dilata hai.
oh, I really like Reese, Not sure what that says about me.	Arre, mujhe vastavme Reez pasand hai, lakin woh mere bare me kya bolta hai malum nahi hai
That is funny but you don't like Kiera. 	Yeh majak ki bat hai lekin apko Kiera pasand nahi hai.
I thought Cumberbach made a great Turing, but it would have been funnier if they cast eminem.	Mujhe laga ki Cumberbakh ne ek mahan turing banaya hai agar woh eminem dalte hai to aur hi majedar hota.
Fitness is very important. Im a big fan of Darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story.	Fitness bahut jaruri hai. Mi Darwin ka bada prasanshak hai jise mujhe kahani me aur dilchaspi huyi.
Well, Darwin had a rough time on the beagle. He was the captain's special steward, which was a demanding job, if you know what I mean.	कुंआ, daarvin ko beegal par ek kathin samay tha. vah kaptaan ke khaas steward tha, jo ek maangalik kaary tha, yadi tumhen maaloom hai ki mera kya matalab hai.
All of the Hollywood rags seemed to speak highly of it.	sabhee holeevud raigs isake baare mein bahut jyaada bolate the
His theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the captain and his station in life, and his feeling of evolution to a higher station in his own life. He was certainly an interesting fellow.	phitanes ka unaka siddhaant mool roop se kaptaan aur jeevan mein unake steshan ke lie unake rishte ka ek saadrshy tha, aur apane jeevan mein ek uchch steshan ke lie vikaas kee usakee bhaavana. vah nishchit roop se ek dilachasp saathee tha.
I seriously loved this Turing movie. You have to see it!!!	mujhe yah tyooring philm bahut pasand aaee. aapako ise dekhana hee hoga!!!
I dont usually take anything the Hollywood reporter says to heart though.	main aamataur par hollywood riportar ko dil se kahata hai ki kuchh bhee mat lo.
No they have their own problems. 	nahin, unakee apanee samasyaen nahin hain.
And what do they know about science?	aur ve vigyaan ke baare mein kya jaanate hain?
Not since they gave The Big Lebowski such awful reviews.	nahin jab se unhonne da big lebovskee ko aisee bhayaanak sameeksha dee.
Turing is an important guy. I'd rather see a movie about Kurt Godel or Giordano Bruno.	tyooring ek mahatvapoorn ladaka hai. balki main kart godel ya jiyordaano broono ke baare mein ek philm dekhoonga.
Or maybe a serious horror/drama about Galileo.	ya shaayad gaileeliyo ke baare mein ek gambheer horar / naatak.
I think the Big Lebowski was a great film I didn't realize it had a poor critical reception.	mere vichar se Big Lebowski great film thi, mujhe nahi maloom tha ki ise poor critical reception mila
I actually think I might write a script about the life of Galileo	me actually sochta hu ki mujhe Galileo ki life ke bare me ek script likhna chahiye
Your right, because Scientifically The Big Lebowski is the best movie ever made. yet, magazines like empire and Variety pee'd on its rug.	tum right ho, kyunki scientifically big Lebowski aaj tak banayi gayi  best film he. iske bawajood, Empire aur Variety jaisi magazines iski apman janak alochna karti he.
people would love that it would make them feel smart.	people pasand karenge ki ye unhe smart feel karayega.
actually, that makes sense.	actually , ye mayne rakhta he
I am actually ordained as a Dudist Priest.	me actually Dudist Priest ke rup me jana jata hu
You can do it online for free, and then you can legally marry people.	tum ise online free me kar sakte ho, aur uske bad tum legally kisi se bhi  marriage kar sakte ho
Go forth and Abide my son.	age bado aur mere bete ko abide karo
Indeed. I shall Abide.	Indeed. me paloonga
oh i know, im also a member dude.	oh, me janata hu, me bhi ek member hu dude
Oh nice. I knew you were coolio foolio.	oh achchha. mujhe pata tha ki tum kooliyo moorkh the.
there is a fun facebook page too, dudeism, check it out!	ek majedaar phesabuk pej bhee hai, yaar, yah jaanch!
What is up with this study though? I feel we are being watched. Do you think we will be in a movie with Benjamin Cumberbach?	haalaanki is adhyayan ke saath kya ho raha hai? mujhe lagata hai ki hamen dekha ja raha hai. kya aapako lagata hai ki ham benjaamin kambarabaich ke saath ek philm mein honge?
I will for sure check it out on the myface.	main nishchit roop se ise myfachai par dekhoonga.
I think there should be parallel networks called myface and spacebook.	mujhe lagata hai ki myfachai aur spachaibook naamak samaanaantar netavark hona chaahie.
haha i use that term Myface all the time.	hah ki main har samay myfachai shabd ka upayog karata hoon.
great minds think alike.	bade man vaale aisa sochate hain.
I once toyed with the idea of opening a coffee shop called dunkin buckstar's	mainne ek baar dankin bakestaar naamak ek kophee kee dukaan kholane ke vichaar ke saath khilavaad kiya
but yes, they say iron knows iron	lekin haan, ve kahate hain ki loha lohe ko jaanata hai
It said there would be three pages, yet we seem to be done.	isane kaha ki teen pej honge, phir bhee ham aisa karate prateet hote hain.
anyways though, it is pretty exciting to see Turing recalibrate that machine. You will enjoy that.	vaise bhee, us masheen ko tyooring reekailibret dekhana kaaphee romaanchak hai. aapako maja aaega.

Is your document about the movie "The Social Network?"	Kya tumhara document movie "The Social Network" ke baare mein hai?
Yes it's about The social Network	Han ye The social Network ke baare mein hai
Cool, so we're on the same document.  You know it's got a score of 96% on Rotten Tomatos.  It's pretty darn good.	Cool, to hai ek hi document pe hai. Tumhe pta hai kya ki isse 96% mile hai Rotten Tomatoes pe. Yehn bahut achha hai.
Yeah the rating is pretty good. Do you check the rating of a movie before you watch it?	Haan rating bahut achhi hai. Kya tum movie dekhne se pehle bhi rating check krte ho?
I usually do.  I normally check the Metacritic Score.  Since this one was 95/100 I figured it would be pretty good.  Did you know that Amie Hammer played two roles?	Main aamtaur pe krta huin. Main Metacritic ka score check krta huin. Chunki yeh 95/100 tha, mujhe lagta hai ye bahut achha score hai. Kya tumhe pta hai ki Amie Hammer ne do roles play kiye hai?
I never noticed. Must be a very good actor.	Maine kabhi dhayan nhi diya. Zarur baht achha actor hoga.
Well, if you look at the document, he played both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.	Ok, agar tum document deko to, usne dono Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss ko play kiya hai.
Do you think Mark Zuckerberg really behaved like the actor in the movie?	Tumhe lagta hai ki Mark Zuckerberg ne ek actor ki tarah behave kiya hai movie mein?
Jesse Eisenberg did a good job of playing the brilliant hero, Founder Mark Zuckerberg.  I thought it was exciting and instinctivly perceptive.	Jesse Eisenberg ne bahut achha kaam kiya hai brilliant hero ka role play krke, Founder Mark Zuckerberg. Mujhe laga ki yeh romaanchak aur sahaj perceptive hai.
I think Justine Timberlake should stick to singing. I didn't buy his role for one second. Did you?	Mujhe lagta hai ki Justin Timberlakeko singing hi krte rehna chahiye. Maine ek second ke liye unki bhoomika nahin kharidi. kya tumane?
You know the character of Mark Zuckerberg was only 19 and he basically started Facebook after being dumped by his girlfriend.	jab mark zuckerberg 19 ke they tab unhone facebook ko start kiya, tab uska girlfriend unhe dumped kiya tha
Yeah. That was a really shallow move by Mark. Though I bet she regrets it now.	acha,, voh tho vaakahi mein shallow move hein mark ko.. lekin voh ache regret karke hogi
Regret is speculative.  The movie's main source was a book called "The Accidental Billionaires" which was was a contentious book that may or may not be believed.  	regret tho speculative hein.. is movie ka main source hein book jo" the accidental billionaires" , jinme kahi maanthe hein
Do you agree with the CinemaScore Rating?	kya aap ko cinema score ka rating par bharosha hein?
Yes. I totally agree on the rating. It really was a good movie	haan, mein unka rating totally agree kartha.. voh vaakahi mein ache movie hein
You know the whole Facebook Experiment started out as a way to increase the dating pool for Harvard students.	yeh whole facebook ka experiment tho us harvard students ke liye banaya gaya hein, jo dating pool ko increase karne ke
Yeah i can see that. Do you think it worked?	haan muje dekh raha hein.. kya yeh work hoga?
I don't think people from Harvard have trouble getting dates.  Do you remember who Andrew Garfield played?	muje nahi lagtha hey ki harvard ko trouble hoga dates ko paane mein.. kuch andrew garfield ka play yaad hein?
I really don't. I was surprised to find out how the name facebook came about. Do you think Christy Lee brags about it?	nahi yar.. muje tho surprised huva jab facebook ka naam bahar aaya tho.. tho christy lee ke brags ke baare mein kya soch raha hein?
Perhaps.  I found it interesting that before Facebook, it was called "The Facebook."  Do you remember the co-founder of Napster?	tho facebook tho interesting hein, mein tho usse THE FACEBOOK hi bolta , kya aapko napster ka cofounder yaad hein?
Yes. He actually made them drop "The" from the name to become just Facebook.	Han. Usne vaastav mein "The" ko nam se hta diya sirf Facebook banane ke liye.
Do you remember where they moved to in California when they started the company?	Kya tumhe pta hai ki wo California mein kahan gye jab unhone company start ki thi?
I believe they used the house as the company headquarters.	Mujhe lagt hai ki unhone ghar ka use kiya tha company headquarters ke taur par.
Do you remember how much academic probation Ma rk Zuckerberg got?	Kya tumhe yaad hai ki Mark Zuckerberg ko kitni acedemic probation mili thi?
Yes. I hear silicon valley has one of the higest rates in rent	Han. Maine suna hai ki silicon valley mein sabse zyada rent rate hai
yeah I think it was 6 months probation? correct me if I am wrong	han mujhe lagta hai ki 6 months ka probation? Mujhe sahi kar dijiye agar main galat huin to
Yes, it was 6 months of Academic probation.  I enjoyed how the narrative was inter cut with scenes from the deposition,  What did you like?	Han, wo 6 months ka Academic probation tha. Mujhe maja aaya ki kaise narrative ne inter cut ke saath scenes ki deposition ki, tumhe kya achha lga?
I liked the whole court process. I think everyone came out a winner	Mujhe saari court process achhi lagi. Mujhe lagta hai ki sabhi winner bane.
I agree.  Everybody got rich.  Do you remember that last scene when Zuckerberg kept refreshing his old girlfriend's page?  I liked that.  What scene did you like?	Main sehmat huin. Sabhi ameer ho gye. Kya tumhe wo last scene yaad hai jab Zuckerberg baar baar apni purani girlfriend ka page refresh krta rehta hai? Tumhe konsa scene pasand aaya?
I particularly liked the scene where Zuckerberg hacks into the different college database to steal photos because it portrayed computer programming accurately. 	Mujhe vishesh roop se wo scene pasand aaya jahaan Zuckerberg ne alag-alag college database mein photo churaane ke liye hacking ki kyonki ismein computer programming ko sahi tareeke se portray kiya gya tha.
That was lame of him. But we all have our days	voh tho uska hi galat hein. sabhi ko apni aap hota
looking for a movie to watch, have you seen any good ones?	ek philm dekhane ke lie dekh rahe hain, kya aapane koee achchha dekha hai?
There is this one I saw recently with Benedict Cumberbatch - I liked it but it was not accurate historically speaking... 	yah ek aisa hai jise mainne haal hee mein benedikt kambarabaich ke saath dekha - mujhe yah pasand aaya lekin yah aitihaasik roop se sateek nahin tha
What was the name of the movie?	philm ka naam kya tha?
The Imitation Game	nakalee khel
How inaccurate was it historically?	aitihaasik roop se yah kitana galat tha?
If You like historical movies like that I mean - Benedict was awesome btw	yadi aap aitihaasik philmon ko pasand karate hain, to mera matalab hai - benedikt bhayaanak btw tha
well quite	achchhee tarah se
if you watched it as pure fiction was it worth siin?	yadi aap ise shuddh kalpana ke roop mein dekhate hain to kya yah seen ke laayak tha?
seeing?	dekh ke?
What he did - brake the enigma code - in this movie it said ONLY him did it by creating this deciphering machine - where in fact, he used algorithms of Polish Mathematicians  - google it.  	unhonne kya kiya - enagama kod ko brek karen - is philm mein yah kaha ki keval unhonne is dikreephaayaring masheen ko banaakar kiya - jahaan vaastav mein, unhonne polish ganitagyon ke elgoridam ka upayog kiya -yah google kar lijiye
It wasn't "pure" fiction. It was just inaccurate, but yes, I liked it and	yeh pure fiction nahi hein... yeh inaccurate hein magar muje pasand hein
Very interesting, I will	muje bhi pasand hein yar
Keira Knightley - I will watch anything with her ;	keira knightley ke saath kuch bhi mein watch kar sakthi hoon

Do You like historical movies like that ? re You British by any chance ?	tuje bhi historical movies pasand hein kya? are tu british hein na?
yes, but i am not are you	haan yar, magar tu?
I'm Polish :)  that's how I know these facts about that part in history ;)	mein polish hoon.. is liye muje iska history patha hein yar
interesting, i am italiian	acha mein italian hoon yar
Machine he build was actually VERY visually similar to the original one	usne voh machine ko original ke tarah hi build kiya hain
they did a great job with that	unhonne isake saath bahut achchha kaam kiya
I will google the history	main itihaas ko googal karoonga
that is cool,	vah shaant hai,
the machine was working a little bit different though - it was based on mathematical algorithms and not really "words" recognition. they made it look "easy" for the hollywood ;)	masheen haalaanki thoda alag kaam kar rahee thee - yah ganiteey elgoridam par aadhaarit thee aur vaastav mein "shabd" maanyata nahin thee. unhonne ise holeevud ke lie "aasaan" banaaya;)
is it attention grapping	kya yah dhyaan dene yogy hai
that is hollywood 	vah holeevud hai
they do that often	ve aksar aisa karate hain
big part of this is drama and action - MI6 agents involved in this whole operation etc. I think You would like it	isaka bada hissa naatak aur ekshan hai - is poore opareshan mein shaamil emaee 6 ejent aadi mujhe lagata hai ki aap ise pasand karenge
i definitely am thinking about seeingit	main nishchit roop se dekh ke baare mein soch raha hoon
I think they overestimated British role in that time... just saying ;)	mujhe lagata hai ki unhonne us samay mein british bhoomika ko kam kar diya ... bas kah rahe hain;)
that's why I asked You if You were British :) I didn't want to offend You	isliye maine pucha kya tum British ho :) mein tumhe offend nahin karna chahti
i wont hold it to be fctual  	main use factual nahin bata sakti
hi	hi

Hello	namaste
hi	hi
The imitation game is a great movie	imitation game bahoot aachi movie hai
Hey! How's it going?	hey kya haal chaal hein?
How did you like Iron Man?	are iron man ko kaise pasand aaya?
Hi! I like the movie	hi.. muje is movie ko pasand hein
Did you like it?	kya aapko
I thought it was fun too.	haan thoda fun bhi hein yar
What was your favorite character?	tumhara favorite character kon tha?
Ofcourse it is Tony	nishchit roop se wo Tony hai
He's hard to beat I must admit.	Use harana mushkil hai main ye manta hun.
What was your favorite character ?	tumhara favorite character kon tha?
Probably Tony as well - he cracks me up with his deadpan humor.	Probably tony bhi bahut accha hai - usne mujhe apne deadpan humar se crack kar diya
I actually think it's the humor that helps the movie work out.	mujhe actually lagta hai ki wo humor hi tha jis se movie ko work out karne me help mili
Yes he has very good humor and acts with ease	Han uske pass bahut accha humor hai aur wo bahut ease se work karta hai
What element of the movie did you prefer, besides the humor?	Humor ke alawa, tum movie ka kon sa element prefer karoge?
Action sequences. I like the second movie out of all three parts	Action sequences, mujhe teeno parts me se second movie pasand aayi
First movie looks more like a documentary/war	Pehli movie bahut had tak documentary/war jaisi pratit hui
Yeah, the action sequence are pretty good. Love the flying suit!	han, action sequence kafi ache hai. love udne wala suit.
Right. But it was a good way to establish the back story.	sahi. par yeh pichli story establish krne ka acha tarika tha
second part is my favorite with all sports cars in action, upgraded suit	dusra part mera pasandida hai jisme sports cars aciton mai hai, upgraded suit hai
yeah 	han
I know! All those shiny toys.	muje pata hai! sab chamkne wale khilono k bare mai.
Usually, I	jaydatar, mai
m not that big on gadgets like that, but t hey really make it work.	mai uss tarah k gadgets par utna bda nai hu, par yeah sach mai kam karta hai.
I think it's the sort of aesthetics they went for that works for me.	mujhe lagta hai jo mere liye kam karte hain woh aesthetics ki tarah hai
are you expecting another part?	kya tumhe lagta hai dusra part aye ga?
sequel	parinam
Probably. They made so much money with those movies, why would they stop?	Shayad. Unhone un movies se kafi paise bana liye, ve kyun rukenge?
I think they made a billion dollars with those movies	Mujhe lagta hai unhone un movies se bees billion dollars bana liye
yeah.	haan.
What do you think of the flirt/love sub story with Gwyneth Paltrow?	Tum Gwyneth Paltrow ke sath flirt/love sub story ka kya sochte ho?
Honestly I don't remember that one..remind me where exactly it happened	Sach mein mujhe veh yaad nahi..mujhe yaad karwao yeh kahan hui thi
I think toward the end. I thought it was unnecessary.	Main sachti hu ant ki taraf. Mujhe lagta hai yeh jaroori nahi.
But you can see the love story coming from the start.	Lekin tum us prem kahani ko dekh sakte ho jo shuru se shuru hui.
I find it annoying when they feel they have to add love stories to everything.	Jab unko lagta hai ki unhe har cheez mein prem kahani daal deni chaiye tab mujhe chid hoti hai.
But her character still works besides the flirting.	Par uska charitra flirting ke baad bhi chalega.
See that's why I only remember war thing	Dekho isilye mujhe sirf ladai ki cheeze yaad hai
I know - it's more fun to watch, more action-oriented.	mujhe pata hai action-oriented dekhne me jyada mazha aata hai
What about the technology in the movies - do you like the way it's presented?	movies ke technology ke baare mein kya - kya tumhe pasand hai jis tarah se woh present kiye jate hai?
I loved the electro magnet in his heart.	mujhe uske dil pe lagi electro magnet se pyaar tha
oh by the way, I love his attitude in serious fights, humor with music	oh waise bhi, mujhe pasand hai uska attitude serious fights mein, humor music ke saath
I know! He's one of the best actors for super hero movies because he doesn't take himself too seriously.	mujhe pata hai, woh super hero movies mein sabse achcha actor hai kyunki woh apne aap ko seriously nahin leeta.
Gotta go now - fun talking with you!	gotta go now - tumse baat karne mein mazha aaya!
Hello	Hello
Hi, I just saw a movie	Hi, maine just ek movie dekhi
Oh what movie?	Oh kaunsi movie?
Mean Girls starring Lindsay Lohan	Mean Girls jisme Lindsay Lohan star karti hai
Was it good?	Kya wo acchi thi?
Well, I love High School movies for some reason. But this was exceptional. 	Well kuch reason k liye mujhe High School movies acchi lagti hai. But ye to exceptional thi.
So it was a comedy?	To kya wo ek comedy thi ?
Did it win any awards?	Kya usne koi awards jeete?
Yeah. Hilarious. It was written by Tina Fey, not to be mistaken for Sarah Palin.	Haan . Hilarious. Tina Fey ne likha hai Sarah palin k liye mistake na karna
Oh I love comedies, who else was in the movie?	Oh mujhe comedies bahut pasand hai aur kaun tha us movie me ?
i didn't recognize anyone else. Lindsay's always in the news, so I know her. 	Mujhe aur koi pehchan me nahi aaya. Lindsay hamesha news me rahti hai, to wo mujhe pata hai
Yeah she's in a lot of good movies	Haan wo kaafi achi movies me hai
I dunno about awards, but I read that the critics loved it.	Awards ka to pata nahi, but main padha hai k critics ko kaafi pasand aayi.
Nice, I'm looking for a good movie to watch, do  you recommend this one?	Nice, main ek acchi movie dhund raha hu dekhne k liye , kya tum ise recommend karoge?
Yeah, but she's also famous for real life stuff...wild personal life. Sounds like she'll be POTUS one day	Haan but wo real life k liye bhi famous hai, wild personal life. Lagta hai wo ek din POTUS banegi.
I'd recommend it. Besides being a teen movie, its a great conversational flick	Main to recommend karunga. Teen movie hone k sath sath bahut achi conversational movie hai.
she seems just like all the other young actresses	Wo to sabhi young actress type ki lagti hai
so is it suitable to watch with children do you think?	To kya tumhe lagta hai  ye movie baccho k sath dekhne k liye theek hai ?
or do you think it'd be better for a date night movie	Ya phir ye date night movie k hisaab se better hai?
There's some dark comedy involved. At one point, one of the Mean Girls is struck by a bus. So more date night than family one. 	Thodi dark comedy involved hai. Ek point me Mean Girls me se ek ko bus thok deti hai. To family night se jyada Date night k liye hai.
oh that sounds traumatic	oh, jo traumatic lagata hai
are there any scary parts?	kya koi scary parts hisse hain?
i'm a total wuss	meh total weak hai
Regarding awards, it is listed by Rotten Tomatoes as one of the Top 50 Teen Comedies.	Puraskaaron ke sambandh mein, ise top 50 teen comedies mein se ek ke roop mein rotten tomatoes dvaara soocheebaddh kiya gaya hai.
No scary parts. Don't worry.	koi daraavana hissa nahin. chinta mat karo
wow so it should be a good time then	vaah to yah ek achchha samay hona chaahie
is there anything else i should know?	kya aur kuchh hai jo mujhe jaanana chaahie?
i'm not a fan of gross out humor	Main sakal haasy ka prashansak nahin hoon
Yeah, its an intelligent take on the genre. Seems to kinda make fun of it too...ends with the Prom...though not like Carrie fyi, since ur a self-described wuss.	Haan, isaka intelligent genre par hai. thora lagata hai ki yah bhee mazedaar hai ... prom ke saath samaapt hota hai ... haalaanki carrie fyi tarah nahin, kyonki ur ek varnit weak hai.
No, no gross-out humor. 	Nahin, koi sakal haasy nahin.
Here's what's interesting. It was based on a non-fiction book	kya interesting hai ki woh ek no-fiction book par based hai.
oh i love movies based on books	oh muje books par based movie pasand hai
It was based on a book that studied social cliques in high school and their psychological effects on girls. So Tina Fey took that and made it into a comedy. Very unique. 	yeh ek book par based hai jisme high school mai girls ke upar psychological effect par study ki hai islye tina ne le liya aur comedy bana di bhot hi unique hai
sounds interesting	dilchesp lag rhi hai
Hello.	namaste
Hi, I think you should watch LaLa Land. It sounds like it is an amazing movie	haay, mujhe lagata hai ki aapako laala laind dekhana chaahie. aisa lagata hai ki yah ek adbhut philm hai
Who stars in the movie?	movie mein kaun star hai
Ryan Gosling, Emma stone, and John Legend	Ryan Gosling, Emma stone, aur John Legend
I like Ryan Gosling. He is a good actor, but I heard that it was a musical. Is that correct?	mujhe  Ryan Gosling pasand hai. wo acha actor hai,lekin maine suna hai ki wo musical tha. kya ye sahi hai?
Yes, it is a musical romatic comedy! It has the best off all the things that make you feel good! Romance,and comedy.	haan, wo musical romatic comedy hai. isme wo sub kuch hai jo aap ko acha mehsoos karayega, romance aur comedy.
I cannot imagine Ryan Gosling in a musical, but I guess it could work.	main Ryan Gosling ko musical mein imagine  nahi kar sakta,lekin shayad ye chalega
Where does the movie take place?	movie  kahan bani hai
He plays as the Jazz pianist, and he falls in love with Emma Stone. It takes place in Los Angeles. 	wo Jazz pianist bana hai aur usko Emma Stone se mohabbat hojaati hai. ye Los Angeles mein hota hai
Is Emma Stone playing an artist also?	kya Emma Stone bhi artist play kar rahi hai?
She is a aspiting actress in this film. They are both pursuing their dreams. 	wo film mein aspiting actress hai, dono apne khawab pursue kar rahe hain
What part does John Legend play?	John Legend kaunsa part play kar raha hai?
I am not sure what part he pays. In the first part Ryan Gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of I Ran (So far Away), he feels like the song is an isult for a serious musician	muje yaad nahi ki voh kya part me pay kara hoga. pehla part mein toh Ryan Gosling party mein they aur I Ran ko play kar rahe the, lagtha tha ki voh song kisi serious musician ko insult kar rahe hein
What is the time period of the movie? Is it a modern story?	Kis time period ka movie hey yar? Modern story hein kya?
Yes I think it is modern time period	haan yar yeh toh modern time period ki hoga
Have you seen the movie?	kya tu is movie ko dekha kya?
No I have not seen it yet, I want to though. I want to know if they stay together or they have a struggle with their relationship	nahi yar, bas soch raha hoon ki dekhen. muje yaha patha chalna hey ki agar voh dono mil jaathe ya aapas me struggle karte unka relationship
Relationships are tough. I wonder how the two characters handle theirs.	Relationship toh tough hei yar. mein toh aacharya huva ki voh dono kaise yeh handle karte
Emma who plays Mia, writes her own one women play. That sound interesting! Ryan who is playing Sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together. I am thinking they sound like a fun couple.	Emma jo Mia ka role play kiya voh apni aap hi yek women ko play kiya. voh toh bada interesting hey! Ryan jo Sebastian ka role play kiya voh regularly yek club mein perform kar rahe they aur dono move kiya. muje lagtha hein ki dono fun couple hein.
Do you know what the play is about?	aap ko patha hein ki yeh play konsa baare mein hein?
No, sadly I do not know what it is about. I do know that Sebastian does not enjoy the music his band plays in 	nahi yar, sadly muje iske baare mein kuch patha nahi. lakin yeh toh patha ki sebastian ko uska music band ka play bilkul pasand nahi aaya
Is there alot of dancing also?	kya kahi dancing bhi hein kya?
I am not sure on that, but I would think there is. Sounds like it is filled with music! I love a good musical	main us par sure nahi hun, but mujhe lagta hai ki wanha hai. Pratit hota hai jaise ye music se bhara hua hai! Mujhe good musical se pyaar hai
I do too, if it is done well.	main bhi karta hun, if ise acche se kiya jaye.
Does Emma Stone sing as well?	kya Emma stone bhi accha sing kar sakti hai?
When their band has the first tour Mis and Sebastian get into an argument! He thinks she wants him to be unsuccessful	Jab unke band ka first tour tha, Mis aur Sebastian argument me pad gaye! Use lagta hai ki wo use unsuccessful karna chahti hai.
That doesn't bode well for the relationship.	ye relanship ke liye acchi bode nahi hai.
I think she is just an aspiring actress, not a singer. He misses her first play where noone shows up, and she owes the theater money and moves to Nevada since she can not pay. Getting very interesting!	Mujhe lagta hai wo ek aspiring actress hai, na ki singer. Wo apna first play miss karti hai janha koi dekhne wala nahi hoga tha, aur wah theater ke money ko owes karke Nevada chali jaati hai kyunki wo pay nahi kar sakti. Ye bada interesting ho gaya.
Does he go with her to Nevada?	Kya wo uske saath Nevada gaya?
No, she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play. Her first play sounds like it was a bust	No, wo mad thi aur usne use play ko miss karne ke liye forgive nahi kiya. Uska first play aisa laga jaise wo bust ho gaya ho.
It sounds like it. Writing plays must be difficult. Sounds like she took it hard.	Aisa lagta hai ki wo accha hai. Play writing difficult hoga. Aisa lagta hai usne use hard liya hai.
John Legend plays Keith, he is a band member. I bet hes a great bank member!	John Legend ne keith ka role play kiya, wo ek band member hai. Me bet karta hun ki wo ek great bank member hai.
I bet you are right.	Main bet lga skta huin ki tum sahi ho.
I am sure she just did not have enough experience for the play writing and how to execute the play and promote it. 	Main sure huin ki usse enough experience  nhi hai play likhne ka or use execute or promote krne ka.
Well, this sounds like an interesting movie. Thanks for all the information.	Khair, ye ek interesting movie lagti hai. Thanks sabhi information ke liye.
I do hope you will see it. I want to see how the realtionship plays out during the film. 	Main hope krta huin ki tum isse dekhoge. Main dekhna chahta huin ki realtionship kaise chlta hai film mein.
Sounds great.	Bahut badia lagta hai.
The Inception was given a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 86%.	The Inception ko 86% ka Rotten Tomatoes rating given he.
I see Leonardo DiCaprio starred in it as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Tom Hardy.	me dekha  Leonardo DiCaprio isme starred he as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page aur Tom Hardy.
86% is a fair rating.  I felt that this movie was excellent but somewhat 'heady'.  I could see why it isn't everyone's cup of tea.  What rating would you give Inception?	86% fair rating he. Mujhe laga ki ye movie excellent he but somewhat "heady" he.me dekh sakta hu ki kyu ye everyone ka cup of tea he.Tum Inception ko kya rating dete?
I agree. 86% seems fair. 	me agree hu. 86% fair lagti he.
There were some interesting characters in this movie. What character did you relate to most?	Is movie me kuch interesting character the.Kis character se tum sabse adhik relate karte ho?
Leonardo DiCaprio was compelling in the role of Dom.  The Inception seems like a tailor fit role for DiCaprio.  I enjoyed his performance but found that the plot was so inventive that I had a hard time relating directly to any of the characters.  It seemed too divorced from reality.	Leonardo DiCaprio, Dom ke role me Compelling tha.The Inception ka role lagta he ki DiCaprio ke liye tailor fit role tha.mene uska performance enjoy kiya but  mujhe laga ki role itna inventive tha ki kis bhi character se directly  relate karna mere liye  hard he.
Did this movie make you ponder the origins of your own thoughts?	Kya is movie ne tumhe tumhari soch ke baare mein sochne pe majboor kiya?
Well, it was interesting, to say the least. The idea of planting something into another persons subconscious made me think for sure. 	Well, kam bolna interesting tha. Kisi dusre ke subconscious mein kuch plant karne ke idea nei mujhe sure kar diya.
It was pretty "out there".	Bahar bahut sunder h.
Do you like scientific movies?	Kya tumhe scientific movies h?
I adore them.  The more "out there" the better.  	I unse pyar h. Bahar bahut better h.
Did you notice the complexity of the dreamscapes in the movie? I thought it was very inventive.	kya tumne movie mein dreamscapes ki complexity ko notice kiya? Mujhe laga yaha bahut inventive h.
I'm having a hard time recalling some of the specifics.  It's hard to believe this film is almost 10 years old already!  I do recall them growing increasingly more complex and dream like the deeper they went though.	Mujhe kuch specific yaad nai aa rahi h. yaha believe karna mushkil h ki yaha movie 10 saal purani h! Mujhe yaad aa raha h ki yaha din b din complex and dream like ho rhi h.
Did you notice in each dream there was a "kick"?	kya tune notice kiya ki har ek dream mein ek kick h
I did, I loved it!  It was like a dreamy Rube Goldberg contraption.  	Maine kiya, yaha mujhe pasand h! Yaha dremy Rube Goldberg contraption ki tarah h.
Can you imagine yourself in a similar scenario?  They must have had a tremendous amount of trust for each other.  If anything went wrong they could have ended up in 'limbo'.  	kya tum apne aap ko same scenario mein imagine kar sakte ho? Unme bahut jyada trust hona chahiye. Yadi kuch bhi wrong hota h to wo limlbe mein khatm ho sakta h
I couldn't imagine it. Sounds very risky. Especially if the dreamer dies in the dream before the sedative wears off.	mein imagine bhi nahi saktha. voh toh badi risky sound kartha. expecially voh dreamer apna dream mein hi mar jaatha uska sedative wear karne ke pehle hi
If the dreamer died and you end up in 'limbo', where do you think that is?  All of the extractors are living within that consciousness, what would become of them?  (since if he dies, that consciousness will cease to exist.)	agar dreamer mar gaya toh limbo mein end hotha. kaise aise kar sakthe? sabhi extractors issi consciousness mein hi jee rahe hein. kya yeb sab ban baayenge?
Good question, and very thought provoking. In the movie they just went into limbo but I suppose the subconscious dreams would have to adjust to fit the new scenario. It would be scary to have the possibility of forgetting that you are in a dream at all. Do you think it would be worth  the potential setback?	ache question kaafi provoking thought hein. is movie mein voh limbo ke liye gaye hein kyon ki mein subconscious dream par is scenario ko nahi mil paatha. bahut scary dream hein. kya aap ko is potential setback ke baare mein kya haal chaal hein
I think that possibility is much greater than a setback.  I took it to mean that all the extractors as well as the subject would be trapped forever.  In that way it seems much too risky.  The aim is to plant an idea in someones mind without their realizing it, almost like mind control.  I think it would me much easier, and less risky, to sit and negotiate with someone.  Although, that's not at all subversive.  	muje lagtha hein ki is setback thoda jyada hein. muje lagtha hein ki sabhi extractors ko is subject ko trapped kiye gaye hein. is tarah mein toh yeh jyada risky nazar aa raha hein. uska aim ka plant toh koi dusri ka idea hoga jo koi mind control kiya hein. mein soch raha hun ki voh jyada easier ho tha aur risky bhi kam hota aur negotiate bhi kar sakthe. magar sab koi subversive nahi hote
Good point. What did you think about what happened to Mal?	ache point hein. toh aap us mal ko kya huva?
Mal's conflict is pivotal to this film.  For all the layers of intrigue we have diving down into the dreams of the target, Mal's actions plant the idea in our minds that there could be many layers above as well.  Is the reality we began this film in reality at all?  What do you think?	mal ka conflick is film mein pivotal hein. toh sabhi intrigue ko is dream ka target diving hota hein, Mals ka action plant ka idea toh badi layers hein.. reality mein toh is film thoda jyada hi reality ho gaya. kya aap kya sochte hein?
Reality as we know it can be hard. If there was an alternate reality available that was more enjoyable I could see where Mal would want to believe it was the "real" reality. The dreams would have to be extremely detailed and believable to be that convinced. Since Mal committed suicide to attempt to "wake up" for real, I assume the beginning reality was the "real" one. Do you think Cobb should face murder charges for Mal's death?	hakikath mein toh jeena thoda kasth hein. agar koi alternate reality hein toh maja aatha, muje toh us mal ko reality mein believe hi nahi hota. uska dream toh badi detailed aur believable thi ki koi convinced ho saktha. agar mal suicide karne ka dream aatha jab utne se, toh mein reality par believe karte. kya cobb ko, mals ka murder charges lagane ka faisla thik tha?
Absolutely not, the audience knows the real truth.	bilkul nahi yar, audience ko sach patha hota hei
I tend to agree. 	mein bhi agree karunga
It's a good thing Ariadne had the kick setup for Fischer to wake up.	yeh sabhi baath hein ki ariadne ko us fisher ne acha kick setup kiya jab wake up hote par
It is a good thing they didn't get trapped.  Memories of a dying parent would be very strong.  Would a new memory like this make you change your life?	yeh acchi baat hai ki pakde nahi gaye. marte huye parents ki memories bohot strong hoti hai. kya aise ek nayi memory tumhe apni life change karne par majbor karegi?
I think it would. I would want to honor my dying parents requests. How about you?	mujhe lagta hai ha. mai apne marte huye parents ki iccha zarur puri karunga. tum?
I would too.  Would you stay in a dream forever if it were the reality you loved?  	mai bhi. kya tum humesha k liye ek dream me rahoge agar tumhe reality pasand ho?
It would certainly be tempting! How odd would it be to know you are in a dream yet you are getting older, living a whole life? Waking up, you'd be much younger then in the dream. Do you think that would make it more difficult to believe that it is the actual reality?	bohot tempting hoga wo. tumhe kaisa lagega yeh jaan k ki bhale hi tum ek dream me ho par phir bhi tum age kar rahe aur ek life ji rahe? jab jagoge toh tum bohot young hoge dream me. tumhe lagta hai yeh yakeen karna mushkil hoga, actual reality?
Well, it depends.  I'm growing older right now but I believe this is reality.  I'd certainly be happy to die, but then wake up a younger man!  But I have no difficulty believing this is reality because I don't know any better right now.  If I did know this was a dream I'd be happy to stay here because I'd get to live a whole extra life before my next.  What would you do?	waise, it depends. mai abhi budha ho raha aur mujhe lagta hai yeh reality hai. mujhe waise yeh sahi me accha lagega agar mai maru aur phir se zinda jab hou tab young ho jau! waise mujhe yeh manne me koi pareshaani nahi ki yeh sacchai hai kuiki mujhe isse better kuch pata nahi hai. agar yeh ek sapna hai toh mai yaha rehna chachunga kyuki jab mai jagunga toh mujhe ek extra life jeene ko milegi. tum kya sochate ho?
Honestly, I'm not sure but I think it would make my mind play trick on me. "Wait, I just lived my life. How can I now be in a different one?" It would definitely hard to grasp.	mujhe pata nahi, par mujhe yeh zarur lagta hai ki mera mind itna bada dhokha nahi karega mere saath. "maine ek jeevan jiya. ek aur kaise ji sakta mai?" bohot pareshaani hogi yakeen karne me
What did you think of the spinning top totem?	tum kya sochate ho spinning top totem k baare me?
I thought it was the perfect cinematic device.  The spinning creates so much anticipation for what comes next.  Will it fall over, won't it?  Puts you on the edge of your seat.	mujhe lagta hai wo ek perfect cinematic device hai. jo spinning hai wo itna excitement create karti ki ab next kya hoga. kya hoga agar sab bigad gaya? bohot hi zyada thrill.
What kind of totem do you think you would have?	tum kis type ka totem pasand karoge?
I think an eight ball would be exciting and create anticipation. 	mujhe lagta hai eight ball accha hoga aur anticipation create karega
Have you seen the original Toy Story?	kya tumne original Toy Story dekhi hai?
I have seen all three Toy Story movies.	maine teeno Toy Story movies dekhi hain.
Have you seen the original?	kya tumne original dekhi hai?
Yes.  I can't believe the first one came out in 1995!  	Yes. mujhe believe nahi hota ki ye 1995 mein ayi!

Alright, so a more down to earth super hero movie than some. No super aliens or anything like that?	acha, dusre superhero movie se kuch alag hey.. acha tho super aliens ya aur koi ke tarah hei kya?
yeah, I  like superhero films that rely more on technology and skill than superpowers - feels more within the realm of possibility. Critics describe this as having a military thriller feel, as opposed to a stylized comic book frame by frame replay.	haan, muje superhero films pasand hey, kaafi technology aur skill se rely karthe.. lagtha hein ki yeh realm ka possibility hein.. critics tho military thriller ke tarah feel hota jo stylized comic book se opposed tha

they had to pull all available boats including civilian vessels to help all the troops escape	unhaym apne bachav ke liye sare upalabd nav or naagarik jahaajzom ka upyog karna pada

It seems the evacuation was a success here	Aisa lagata hai ki nikaasee yahaan ek saphalata thee
it was, they were able to save enough lives to fight another war	Ya tha ki ve ek aur yuddh ladane kelie paryaapt jeevan bachaane mein saksham the
or should i say battle	Ya mujhe yuddh kahana chaahie
Hmm. it's sad lives become trivialized. they become another resource to exploit for the country	Ya dhukad hai ki desh ke shoshan kelie ve tuchchh ho jaate hain
Anyways thank you for discussing the movie with me	Vaise bhi mere saath film ko charcha karane kelie dhanyavaad

They really don't and they should start making this style.	Bilkul nahin and ab woh start making this style
Yeah exactly 	yes exactly
It was nice to see John Leguizamo make a little bit of a comeback.	yah dekh ke achcha laga ki John Leguizamo ne ek chhota mota comeback kiya hai

Hi are you ready to get started? This is a batman vs superman superhero crossover movie. Are you familiar with those superheroes?	hi tho aap ready ho? yeh tho batman vs superman superhero ka crossover movie hein.. aap tho superheroes se familiar hi honge?
We are here to discuss Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice	hum yaha batman vs superman yaani dawn of justice ke baare mein discuss karenge
Yes i am familar with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard of	haan.. muje characters se familiar hoon lekin kuch actors ko nahi patha hein
I think it sounds like an amazing movie. I love superheroes. I think some of the critics are too harsh. It was a good plot line. I am familiar with Ben Affleck but none of the others. 	mein kya soch rahi thi ki  yeh amazing movies ke tarah sound kartha.. muje superheroes bahut pasan dhein.. muje lagtha hein ki critics thoda harsh hein.. yeh ache plot line hein.. muje ben affleck se kuch familiar hoon lekin dusra muje nahi patha
I wish they would have used more famous people. 	agar voh aur thoda famous logo ko use kar sakthe they
I would agree though that it was not as good as man of steel. The plot line of that was amazing!	mein bhi maantha hoon, ki voh ache nahi hein us man of steel ke tarah.. plot line tho amazing hein
Ben Affleck is the only actor I recognize great plot very harsh critcs	sirf ben affleck hi yek actor jo ache tarah recognize kiya jo harsh critcs se
I agree. I didn't completely understand why Batman and Superman fought though. 	mein maantha hoon... muje yeh understand nahi hota ki kyon batman aur superman aapas mein fight karthe
Rotten Tomatoes list it as 27%and average with a 4.9 out of 10. The critcs must be weird. Yeah i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad	rotten tomatoes neh 27% di aur uska average tho 4.9/10 tha... critics tho weird hein... haan, muje bhi is fight ko figure out nahi kar paa raha hoon, lekin kuch samaj aarahi hein ki kyonki superman ko acceidentally bruce wayne ka dad maar daala
I thought it was worth a meteoritic score more than 44. That seemed low! That makes sense. I would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my family members. 	muje laga ki yeh worth meteroitic score 44 ke se upper hein.. lekin low nikla.. mein tho mad hota agar koi mera family ko aise koi maar dethe
hello?	hello
Yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of Lex Luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole movie. I like how the critic talked about Lex (who is supermans arch enemy ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler (who are batmans arch enemies	yeh tho unique spin hey lex luthor ka character ko jo whole movies mein nazar aathe.. muje tho unka bol pasand hein, jaise critic ko lex ke saath bola kyon ki dono aapas me compared kar rahe the ki kon joker aur riddler hein
Then he tops off the crazy part by comparing him to Mark Zuckerburg. 	fir donon compare karthe karthe crazy hote aur mark zuckerburg tak pahun jaathe
Ohh. I liked that too. I like how they always try to biring in the government official s	acha.. muje bhi pasand hein.. muje tho voh pasand hein jab government official ko yaha laane ke try kar rahe they
Yeah im still here just slow typer	haan mein yahi hi hoon, mein thoda slow typer hoon
Do you like batman or superman better in the movie?	kya aapko is movie mein batman ya superman pasand hein?
Actually superman 	actually superman
How bout u	thera kya soch hai
I grew up watching the justice league cartoons in thelate 70s and early 80s in which alll the superheros worked together.	mai 70 aur 80s ke justice league cartoon ko dekthey huye bada huva hun jis mai sabhi superheros sath me kaam karthe the
I love batman	mujhe batman pasand hai
He is so mysterious 	wo bohuth ysterious hai
Sorta ironic that they become enemies 	ye ironic hai ki wo dushman ban gaye
Yes he is very mysterious	haan wo mysterious hai
It is. Its not what I expected at all	ye hai.  jo maine expect kiya tha who ye nahi hai
I expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together 	main ise kuch avengers ke jaise expect kiya that jis may kuch heroes saath mai kaam karthe hai
I don't really like that they are enimies	way dusman hai ye mujhe bilkul pasand nahi hain
Especially to the point where batman was going to kill superman 	khas kar ke jab batman superman ko marne wala tha
Me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent was trying to make bruce wayne and batman look bad thru his news articles	main bhi but superman ne ye starty kiya, article me clark kent bruce wayna aur batman ko bura dikhane ki koshish kar raha hai
You know though to be honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies. 	tum jaante ho to be honest agar duniya ko aise dekhoge jaise abhi hai to unka dushman hona makes perfect sense
I guess so. They do have polar opposite personalities. One is a humble farm boy and the other is a rich executive 	I guess so. Unki bilkul polar opposite personalities hai. Ek to humble farm boy hai dusra ek rich executive
I could see why they clash in that aspect, but I guess I don't imagine them interacting very much in superhero world. 	Main dekh sakta hu ke us aspect me kyu clash karege but main superhero world me jyada interact karte hue imagine nahi karta.
It says in the 3rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce way e apol9gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman	Aisa bolte hai ke 3rd part me superman ke funeral k dauran bruce lois lane se maafi mangta hai ye bolte hue k he failed superman
DUUHHHH well yeah he failed him if he killed him lol	DUHHHHH well han agar tumne use maar diya matlab you failed him lol
I would feel like if I failed someone if I let them die too. Haha. I like the mysterious dirt levitating though 	Mujhe bhi aisa lagega k I failed someone agar maine unhe marne diya. haha, mujhe dhool ka  mysterious levitate karna accha laga
Haha 	Haha
Thats what I was thinking 	Main bhi yahi soch raha hai
Little humor there	Thoda humor waha
Have u seen this movie 	Tumne movie dekhi hai
No have you? is that the end?	No have you? woh end hai kya?
I can't tell	bata nahi sakta
Oh yeah. It is.	Arre haan. It is.
I wonder if there will be a sequel 	Uska seqeul hoga kya I wonder
Yes watched it 3 times its a tearjerker for me when superman dies	Haan maine teen baar dekhi its a tearjerker for me jab superman marta hai
I feel like good superhero movies need sequels 	Mujhe lagta hai acchi superhero movies ke sequel hone chahiye
I dunno could be a sequel 	Could be a sequel pata nahi mujhe
Like how superman didnt really die he just hibernated til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman	Jaise superman asliyat mein mara nahi tha usne bas hibernate kiya tha til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman
Hi!	hi
Have you seen Real Steel?	kya tumne real steel dekhi
No, haven't seen it. Have you?	nahi deki kya tumne dekhi
No i haven't 	nahi maine nahi dekhi
It's a sci-fi movie and i don't typically watch those	yah sci-fi moivehai mai eashi movi pasand nahi karta
Not sure it's that good. It has a score of 59% on Rotten Tomatoes.	sayad utni achi na ho ,rottten tomatoes ne ieshe 59% score diye hai
That's what I was thinking also	mai bhi yahi soch ta hu
Actually, I kind of like sci-fi, but I'm picky.	vaise mai sci-fi pasand karta hu lakin mai picky hu
Yes I can agree with that it depends for me	mai isse agree kar sakta hu yah mujh par bhi depend karta hai
This one sounds more like an action flick in a sci-fi setting.	ish moive ki sound like action flick jaise hai
ah that would make sense 	wah ye yek bat hai
it also has sports?	yeh sports ka hein?
I thought more sci-fi because it was also a twilight zone episode	scifi ka, kyon ki isme twilight zone ka episode bhi hein
But the "Rocky with Robots" line makes me doubt that I would like it.	lekin rocky with robots tho muje doubt hein,
I didnt catch that but I'm with you 	muje kuch samaj nahi aaya lekin mein samajne ke koshish karunga
I've never seen any Rocky's either	rocky tho mein kahi dekha nahi hein
And I didn't know it was a Twilight Zone episode.	aur muje twilight zone episode ke baare mein tho kuch patha nahi hein
Ha! Me neither. Haven't seen the Rocky movies.	muje bhi... rocky movies dekha nahi hey
That's kind of odd to me i feel like most everyone has seen them 	kuch off hein mere liye... kyon ki agar koi kuch aise puche
The premise of this one is not so stupid though. Robot boxers. I feel it could become real at some point.	iska premise bhi itna stupid bhi nahi hein, robot tho boxers hein... muje tho real ke tarah feel huva us point mein

And he's better looking haha	par vash achcha dikha raha hai

It sounds as though this is pretty predictable as well and I like movies that I can't guess  the end	Mujhe movie pasand hai jiska end guess nahi kar sakate.uska sound thoda predictable hai
The whole Real Steel story seems like a series of machinations of bad guys against good guys, without much else.	REAL STEEL KA STORY THO SERIES OF MACHINATION US BAD GUYS JO GOOD GUYS SE AGAINS HEIN,
Same here. This one sounds like it's been writ ten by committee.	SAME YAR... KUCH COMMITEE KE TARAH SOUNDS KARTHA
Right I do like that it's a a family movie- I don't have kids but I feel like it would be ok for my nephew	RIGHT, MUJE BHI FAMILY MOVIE DEKHNA PASAND HEIN, MUJE KIDS NAHI HEIN LEKIN MEIN APNI NEPHEW KE SAATH DEKHTHA
I really don't think it's my type of movie.	MUJE NAHI LAGTHA KI YEH MERA TYPE KA MOVIE HEIN.
Me either but sometimes it's about the kids and a little boy would like the robots and battles	MUJE BHI, SOMETIMES MUJE LAGTHA KI YEH KIDS AUR CHOTA BOY KE BAARE MEIN HEIN JO ROTBOTS AUR BATTLES PASAND KARTE
Yeah, maybe it's OK for kids. They like the predictable storylines.	HAAN, MAYBE YEH KIDS KE LIYE THO OK HEIN.. PREDICTABLE STORYLINE HEIN
well not "little" but grade school	WELL, LITTLE THO NAHI LEKIN GRADE SCHOOL
Still... the good guys against bad guys works well at that age.	STILL. GOOD GUYS THO BAD GUYS SE ACHE TARAH AGAINST KARTHE, JO IS AGE KE LIYE THO ACHE WORK KIYA

seems kinda like a typical family-action film with some scifi elements	family action film ke tarah hein thoda scifi elements bhi

Yes it is sort of the family type of film. But I got very much into the characters especially Hugh Jackman's.	haan kuch family type ka film jaise hi hey.. lekin muje unka characters bahut pasand hein especially hugh jackmans ka
was interesting to see Hugh play a more domestic role 	kya hugs ko domestic role play karne pe interesting hoga

I guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with Morcom, his mentor.	han yar yeh toh espionage movie nikla. bahut excite hein usme. muje lagtha hein ki usme kuch drama apni boarding school ka experiences mein se likha hoga aur morcom mein padne se likha hoga jo uska mentor tha
I think you will enjoy it.	muje laga ki tu enjoy karega
Morton Tyldum is a great director.	morton tyldum bahut badiya director hein
Andrew grant and that rag science news never gets it right, if he liked it i will probably hate it.	voh andrew grant aur uska rag science ka news kabhi bhi right nahi hota, agar voh ushe pasand aaya tho mein use hate karunga
The hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of Cumberpatch as i am.	voh hollywood reporter toh cumberpatch nikhla, jaisa mein hoon.
It is kind of technical. It goes pretty in depth about his machine to break the code. He has some breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows. You will probably enjoy that.	ye technical type ka hai, code break karne ke liye machine me bahut deep jana padta hai. use ek breakthrough milta hai jab use ye realize hota hai ki wo use pahle se malulm words se wo is program kar sakta hai. tum enjoy karoge ise.
Cumberbach does a great job acting.	kamal ki acting ki hai Cumberbach ne.
These storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it interesting that it kinda distorts history in my opinion.	mere opinion me true stories pe based ye story hamesha history ko distort karti hain use interesting banane ke liye.
The bit about getting married to Keira Knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting. I might warn you about all that.	Keira Knightley se marriage ko lekar jo wakya hai, wo thoda annoying hai agar aap uski acting ko leke thode favorable nahi hai to. tumhe iske bare me warn kar raha hu.
It is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life. I see your point there.	interesting baat ye hai ki yah movie us play par based hai, jo uski life par likhi book par based hai. tumhara point dekh sakta hu mai.
I would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film, the good acting, and even the half made up story!	mai probably film ke technical aspect ko enjoy karu, badhiya acting, aur half cooked story.
I think also where it is a movie about a mathematician, it kind of helps to add in some plot elements. I think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting.	I think also yah movie ek mathematician ke baare men hai, plot me thode elements dalna helpful hai. par mujhe ye unusual laga kyonki uski life to waise hi itni interesting hai.
There is quite a bit of espionage involved as well. I suppose I am not spoiling it since it is history, but there is some Russian collusion involved.	isme espionage ka angle bhi involve hai. I suppose mai  kuch spoil nahi kar raha hu kyonki ye history hai, but kuch Russian secret bhi involved hai.
If he marries Keira knightly i may be shouting at my T.V.	agar wo Keira knightly se marriage karega to mai shayad T.V. par hi shout karne lagu.
Big drama when Turing confronts the russians.	bada drama hua jab Turning Russians ko confront karta hai.
Yeah you might have to fast forward through the lurid romance. It is not so bad though.	haan, aapako phurteela romaans ke maadhyam se aage badhana hoga. yah haalaanki itana bura nahin hai.
She is trite, absolutely, but the director does make it work here.	vah bilkul trait hai, lekin nirdeshak ise yahaan kaam karate hain.
also, turns out he is gay!	yah bhee pata chala ki vah samalaingik hai!
so she gets what she deserves.	isalie use vah milata hai jisaka vah hakadaar hai.
you might actualy like it.	aap ise pasand kar sakate hain.
I didn't really get that part, but who can understand the gays?	mujhe vaastav mein vah hissa nahin mila, lekin samalaingikon ko kaun samajh sakata hai?
Well, that kinda of makes it more inviting to me, Keira Nightly must be sad to find that out!	khair, yah thode ise aur adhik mere lie aamantrit karata hai, keira naitalee ko yah pata lagaane ke lie dukhee hona chaahie!
yeah I think she was pretty upset. Like I said I didn't really understand all of that. I was mostly in it for the math. What an interesting, fascinating story.	haan, mujhe lagata hai ki vah bahut pareshaan thee. jaisa mainne kaha ki main vaastav mein us sab ko samajh nahin paaya hoon. main jyaadaatar ganit ke lie isamen tha. kya dilachasp, aakarshak kahaanee hai.
I think Turing was gay for his mentor or something, but he dies.	mujhe lagata hai ki tyooring apane guru ya kuchh aur ke lie samalaingik tha, lekin vah mar jaata hai.
Sounds a bit like Beautiful mind that was a great movie, too!	sundar dimaag kee tarah lagata hai ki ek mahaan philm thee, bhee!
Tuberculosis.	Tuberculosis.
Yeah I did love Beautiful mind. I read that that guy actually was working for the government.	Haan Beautiful mind accha laga.maine padha hai woh government main kaam karta tha.
Talk about changing the story!	story badalne ke baare main batao!
Turing's story is pretty sad. He got bullied a lot at boarding school. Seems to have affected him a lot. Too bad he wasn't able to find love. Maybe he should have gone for somebody besides Kiera Knightley!	Turing ki story bahut sad hai. usko boarding school main bahut bully kia gaya.Lagta hai woh bahut affect hua. Too bad use love nahin mila. Maybe use Kiera Knightley ke alava kisi aur ko jaana chahiye tha!
How come you dislike her so much?	kaise tum use itna dislike kar sakte ho?
Is it because you guys used to date?	kya isliye ki tum log dating karte the?
Mostly just for hogging that driftwood in Titanic ;)	Mostly driftwood ke hogging ke liye Titanic mein:)
Oh yeah. I have never seen that one. 	Oh haan. Maine kabhi nahin dekha tha usko.
I find her Wiry, trite, and egotistical. I only enjoy those qualities in myself.	mujhe woh Wiry,trite aur egotistical laga. Mujhe sirf who qualities apne mein lagta hai.
I know there is that song by celine dion.	mujhe malum hai woh song celine dion se hai.
haha that is funny. I figured that but didn't want to say.	Ha Bahut hi majedar hai. Hum ko malum tha ki bat karna nahi chahete
She is kind of a walking plattitude. Kind of like Reese Witherspoon, but more indiana less texas	Woh ladki chalne wali sadharan hai. Reese Witherspoon ki tarah, lekin jyada indiana aur kum Texas
or something	ya kuch kuch
Oh, its ok. Im not blind. However after looking at Keira Knightley for 2 hours i might be.	Arey teek hai. Hum andha nahi hai. Lekin do ghante tak hum Keira Knightly ko dekhne ke badh,  ho sakta hai
Still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told, ill have to tune in.	Phir bhi is kahani aisa mahatwa lagta hai ki sabhi ko batana chahiye. Humko sunna padega.
anyways she didn't ruin the movie. If anything, Turing's life ruins the movie. It's just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love. He could have just worked out, made some friends, and been happy. It is a very important story. Reminds me of the life of Charles Darwin, or Plato.	Vise bhi usne philam ko barbad nahi kiya. Turing ka jeevan film ko barbad kar deta hai. Bahut dukh ki bat hai ki voh tung agaya aur sam legik prem ka sharan leta hai. Woh kam kar sakta tha, kuch dost bana sakta tha, aur khush reha sakta tha. Yeh to ek bahut hi mahatpurna kahani hai. Charles Darwin ya Plato ka yad dilata hai.
oh, I really like Reese, Not sure what that says about me.	Arre, mujhe vastavme Reez pasand hai, lakin woh mere bare me kya bolta hai malum nahi hai
That is funny but you don't like Kiera. 	Yeh majak ki bat hai lekin apko Kiera pasand nahi hai.
I thought Cumberbach made a great Turing, but it would have been funnier if they cast eminem.	Mujhe laga ki Cumberbakh ne ek mahan turing banaya hai agar woh eminem dalte hai to aur hi majedar hota.
Fitness is very important. Im a big fan of Darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story.	Fitness bahut jaruri hai. Mi Darwin ka bada prasanshak hai jise mujhe kahani me aur dilchaspi huyi.
Well, Darwin had a rough time on the beagle. He was the captain's special steward, which was a demanding job, if you know what I mean.	badiya, darwin ka bura time tha beagle par. Wo captain ka special steward tha, jo ki ek demanding job thi, agar tum jante ho ki mera kya matlab he
All of the Hollywood rags seemed to speak highly of it.	Hollywood ke sare newspaper uski badi badi karte dikhai dete hain
His theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the captain and his station in life, and his feeling of evolution to a higher station in his own life. He was certainly an interesting fellow.	Uski theory darasal ek analogy thi uski captain and station ke life ke liye, or uski apni life main evolution to a higher station ke feeling ke liye. Wo waqai ek interesting admi tha
I seriously loved this Turing movie. You have to see it!!!	seriously mujhe Turing movie pasand ayi. Tumhain dekhni hogi
I dont usually take anything the Hollywood reporter says to heart though.	halanki main dil par nahin leta jobhi hollywood ke reporter ne kaha
No they have their own problems. 	nahin unki apni problems hain
And what do they know about science?	or wo science ke bare main kya jante hain
Not since they gave The Big Lebowski such awful reviews.	jabse unhone the big lebowski jese awful reviews tabse nahin
Turing is an important guy. I'd rather see a movie about Kurt Godel or Giordano Bruno.	Turing ek important admi he. Main iske bajae kurl Godel ya giordano bruno ki movie dekhunga
Or maybe a serious horror/drama about Galileo.	or shayad Galileo ke bare main serious horror/drama
I think the Big Lebowski was a great film I didn't realize it had a poor critical reception.	mere vichar se Big Lebowski great film thi, mujhe nahi maloom tha ki ise poor critical reception mila
I actually think I might write a script about the life of Galileo	me actually sochta hu ki mujhe Galileo ki life ke bare me ek script likhna chahiye
Your right, because Scientifically The Big Lebowski is the best movie ever made. yet, magazines like empire and Variety pee'd on its rug.	tum right ho, kyunki scientifically big Lebowski aaj tak banayi gayi  best film he. iske bawajood, Empire aur Variety jaisi magazines iski apman janak alochna karti he.
people would love that it would make them feel smart.	people pasand karenge ki ye unhe smart feel karayega.
actually, that makes sense.	actually , ye mayne rakhta he
I am actually ordained as a Dudist Priest.	me actually Dudist Priest ke rup me jana jata hu
You can do it online for free, and then you can legally marry people.	tum ise online free me kar sakte ho, aur uske bad tum legally kisi se bhi  marriage kar sakte ho
Go forth and Abide my son.	age bado aur mere bete ko abide karo
Indeed. I shall Abide.	Indeed. me paloonga
oh i know, im also a member dude.	oh, me janata hu, me bhi ek member hu dude
Oh nice. I knew you were coolio foolio.	oh achchha. mujhe pata tha ki tum kooliyo moorkh the.
there is a fun facebook page too, dudeism, check it out!	ek majedaar phesabuk pej bhee hai, yaar, yah jaanch!
What is up with this study though? I feel we are being watched. Do you think we will be in a movie with Benjamin Cumberbach?	haalaanki is adhyayan ke saath kya ho raha hai? mujhe lagata hai ki hamen dekha ja raha hai. kya aapako lagata hai ki ham benjaamin kambarabaich ke saath ek philm mein honge?
I will for sure check it out on the myface.	main nishchit roop se ise myfachai par dekhoonga.
I think there should be parallel networks called myface and spacebook.	mujhe lagata hai ki myfachai aur spachaibook naamak samaanaantar netavark hona chaahie.
haha i use that term Myface all the time.	hah ki main har samay myfachai shabd ka upayog karata hoon.
great minds think alike.	bade man vaale aisa sochate hain.
I once toyed with the idea of opening a coffee shop called dunkin buckstar's	mainne ek baar dankin bakestaar naamak ek kophee kee dukaan kholane ke vichaar ke saath khilavaad kiya
but yes, they say iron knows iron	lekin haan, ve kahate hain ki loha lohe ko jaanata hai
It said there would be three pages, yet we seem to be done.	isane kaha ki teen pej honge, phir bhee ham aisa karate prateet hote hain.
anyways though, it is pretty exciting to see Turing recalibrate that machine. You will enjoy that.	vaise bhee, us masheen ko tyooring reekailibret dekhana kaaphee romaanchak hai. aapako maja aaega.
did you leave?	aapane chhod diya?
hoii	hoii
Hi. I loved the film, even though it's older, from 1975. Did you like it?	hi, muje voh film bahut pasand aaya, vaakahi mein mein 1975 ke haein, aapko pasand aaya kya?

Is it a family movie?	kya yeh ek family movie hai?
Oh okay	oh theek hai
I think so	mere khayaal se to
I wonder if my 4 year old would enjoy it? Maybe he's too young?	main sochta hun agar mere 4 saal ke bache ko acha laga? shayad vo bacha hai
If it's colorful and funny I think he will enjoy it. Did the article say it was a funny movie too?	agar ve rang biranga aur majedaar ho to vo pasand karega. kya lekh ne bi movie ko funy batae?
May be you would be afraid, because its  a monster movie	shayad tum darte hoge kyun ki veh ik monster movie thi

Lol, I think we could be best friends just you saying that.	Lol, mujhe lagta hai tumhare bas is statement bolne se hum best friend ban sakte hai

Hey there!	hey there
yes	haan
Have you seen the Shape of Water? It is an amazing movie 	kya aap the shape of water dekhe ho? amazing movie hein
I don't see a paragraph about a movie. Is anyone else in here?	main ek philm ke baare mein ek pairaagraaph nahin dekhata. yahaan koee aur hai?
Hi! Have you seen the movie The Imitation Game?	namaste! kya aapane philm da imiteshan gem dekhee hai?
I haven't. What's that about?	mainne nahin kiya hai yah kis baare mein hai?
It's a 2014 American historical drama about real life cryptoanalyst Alan Turing.	yah vaastavik jeevan kee kriptokaransee elan tyooring ke baare mein 2014 ka amerikee aitihaasik naatak hai.
Do you like biopics? If you do this movie might interest you.	kya aapako baayopiks pasand hai? yadi aap is philm ko karate hain to aap ruchi le sakate hain.
It sounds interesting. What does Alan Turing do?	yah dilachasp lagata hai. elan tyooring kya karata hai?
He decrypted German Intelligence codes for the British government during WWII. 	unhonne wwii ke dauraan british sarakaar ke lie jarman intelijens kod ko dikript kiya.

Okay, have you heard of The Post?	kya tumne post ko suna hai
Are you there?	tum vaha the
Yes, sorry for the delay. I did see the movi e recently. I don't usually enjoy political films, but I thought it was quite well done.	ha ,maf karna maine abhi vah moive dekhi vaise me political base moive pasand nahi karta but ye kafi achhi thi
No worries.  Oh, yeah, I thought Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks were both pretty good.	koi nahi oh muje lagta hai Maeryl Steep AUR tOM hANKS DONO BRIYA HAI
So, it apparently has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 88%, which surprises me because, like you said, most people don't seem to go for political thrillers.	jaise rotten tomatoes ne ise 88% ki rating di mai surprised hu kayoki jayda log political thrillers nahi dekte
I think it has a lot to do with the cast, to be honest. Meryl and Tom and Sarah Paulson as well. If they didn't get those larger names, more people would have ignored it.	muje lagta hai cast ne kafi  acha kiya hai jaise meryl ,tom,aur sarah ,agar unke naam itne bare nahi hote to log unhe ignor kar dete
I'm looking to see who Sarah Paulson played. I saw it too...	mai dekhna chahuga sarah paulson kaun play karta hai mai bhi
Oh, she was Tony!	ACHA THO TONY HEIN VOH
It's described as an American historical thriller, which I guess I agree with, given the nature of the Pentagon Papers.	AMERICAN HISTORICAL THRILLER SE DESCRIBED KIYA HEIN, JO MUJE GUESS KI VOH NATURE KA PENTAGON PAPERS DIYA HOGA
I didn't realize it was directed by Steven Spielberg.	MUJE REALIZE HI NAHI HOTA KI STEVEN SPIELBERG NE DIRECT KIYA HAIN
I feel like the struggle between the media and the people in power is always relevent	MUJE FEEL HOTA KI YEK POWER KELIYE MEDIA AUR PEOPLE DONO STRUGGLE KARTE JO RELEVANT HEIN
Yeah. It was interesting to see how the court case played out and how the newspapers sort of stood together.	HAAN.. KAAFI INTERESTING HEIN, JAISE KAISE COURTCASE NE PLAYED OUT KIYA AUR KAISE NEWSPAPER NE US STOOD KO AAPAS MEIN SORT OUT KIYA
Matthew Rhys was in it too...I like him as an actor.	MATTHEW RHYS BHI THEY.. MUJE UNHE PASAND HEIN
Critics seemed to be torn about the movie..	IS MOVIE MEIN THO TORN HI BEHETAR CRITICS SE SAATH
One said, "The Post passes the trickiest tests of a historical drama...	YEK KAHA KI," IS POST THO TRICKIEST TEST PASSE HUVA HEI IS HISTORICAL DRAMA MEIN..
Another said, "is too calculated to reflect today's ragged, tenuous sociopolitical climate."	DUSRA KAHA KI,"AAJKAL KA RAGGED THO THODA REFLECT HEIN CALCULATE KARNE PE, TENUOUS SOCIOPOLITICAL CLIMATE."
Do you think you would see it again?	KYA AAP DUBARA DEKHNE KO PASAND KARENGE?
I I think seeing it a second time would be helpful to pick up the little things I might have missed. I'm not sure I would categorize it as calculated. It was intense, but I thought in a good way.	mujhe lagata hai ki yah doosaree baar dekhane se madad milegee jo mainne yaad kiya ho sakata hai chhotee cheejon ko lene ke lie. mujhe yakeen nahin hai ki main ise ganana ke roop mein vargeekrt karoonga. yah teevr tha, lekin mainne achchhe tareeke se socha. Show less
Who was your favorite actor in the movie?	Tumhara manpasand hero kon hai movie main
Meryl Streep for sure. being the first female publisher  of a major news source, it was really amazing to see her part in the struggle and how it was unique to that role	meril streep ke lie sunishchit karen. ek pramukh samaachaar srot kee pahalee mahila prakaashak hone ke naate, sangharsh mein apane hisse ko dekhana vaastav mein aashcharyajanak tha aur us bhoomika ke lie yah kaise adviteey tha
Yeah there were some moments in the movie for sure.	Hnji, movie main kuch moment jaroor honge
I didn't realize the employee who leaked the papers had worked at the RAND corporation.	mujhe is baat ka ehasaas nahin tha ki kaagajaat leek karane vaale karmachaaree ne rand korporeshan mein kaam kiya tha.
What did you think of Tom Hanks' performance in the movie? 	Tumhe tom hanks ka movie main kaam kaisa lga
I thought it was really good. He does really well at things set more  in the past, like the 70s in this one.	socha ki yah vaastav mein achchha tha. vah vaastav mein achchhee tarah se ateet mein set kee gaee cheejon ko achchhee tarah se karata hai, jaise ki is 70 ke dashak mein। Show less
I didn't really understand why the Rand employee had leaked the info in the first place. Did you catch that?	: main vaastav mein samajh mein nahin aaya ki raind ke karmachaaree ne pahalee jagah mein jaanakaaree kyon leek kee thee. kya aapane use pakada? Show less
O r rather did you catch why? I feel like I must have missed something.	o aar balki tumane pakada kyon? mujhe aisa lag raha hai ki mujhe kuchh yaad aa gaya hoga.
No, I think he was just disenchanted with the war and how we had escalated our involvement. 	nahin, mujhe lagata hai ki vah yuddh se vimukh tha aur hamane apanee bhaageedaaree ko kaise badhaaya tha.
Apparently Ellsberg overheard Robert McNamara saying he thought the war was hopeless, even though he was telling the public it was going well, and he became disillusioned about that and decided to leak the truth.	ellsberg tho robert mcnamara se bol raha tha ki yeh war hopeless hein, even though voh voh public ke saath bole ki yeh ache jaayega aur voh disillusioned ban gaye aur truth leak karne ke decide kiya
(It was YEARS LATER that he actually decided to leak the info)	haan, kahi saal ke baat voh  truth karne ko leak kiya
That was a plot detail I definitely missed. Must have been an early scene in the movie.	voh plot detail tho mein definitely missed karunga.. is movie mein early scene honge
Oh, you're right! I forgot that he had overheard that conversation. I'm glad Tom Hank's character was able to figure out it was he who had  leaked the info, and got all of the information he needed for the Post.	oh tho sahi hein! muje tho bhool hi gaya ki voh overheard hein is conversation mein.. muje khus hein ki Tom hank's ka character figure out kar sakthe aur info ko leaked huva aur saari info jo unhe post karne ko soch
Yeah it was interesting how that developed. Do you remember how the legal issues developed? It says something about the paper's source being the same as the NYT's source. I had forgotten the NYT published something first.	haan, yeh interesting hein jo developed hein.. kya aap ko yaad hein ki kaise legal issues developed huva? yeh kuch paper's source ke baare mein hein jo NYT ka source bhi hein... muje NYT ka publish tho bhool hi gaya
Yeah having the same source put Graham possibly  in contempt of court.	haan, same source se rahana, graham ko possibly us contempt ka court
Do you think Graham made the right choice to publish?	kya aap sochte graham publish karne ka right choice hein?
I'm a little torn, but, given the seriousness of the issue, yes. Normally I would tend to side with the government, but this was really mismanaged. It was an important decision for the court to side with the paper.	mein tho thoda torn, lekin yeh seriousness issue hein... haan... normally, mein tho government ka side hon, lekin voh mismanaged hein.. yeh tho unka important decision hein court ka us paper ko side rakhna
I just got another update...	haan muje dusra update  mila..
Here is a question for you - would you recommend this movie to people you know (who haven't seen it)?	aap ke liye yek question- kya aap is movie ko recommend karenge?
I would recommend it for sure to most people. despite it taking place int he 70's, I feel Spielberg took it in a really exciting direction instead of just throwing facts at you about the case.	mai isse jayada logo ko recommand karta hu,bavjud he place 70,muje lagta hai spoelberg exciting hai
I think it was filmed well, and I was surprised how much suspense built even though I already knew the basic facts.	yah ek achi film thi ,mai surprised hu itne jayada suspense the jabki mai sare fact janta ta
There were so many details I had no idea about. And I like how it sort of set the stage for the Watergate scandal right afterwards with Nixon.	isme itne sare detail the muje idea nahi tha,aur muje pasant aya watergate scandal nixon ke saath
I completely forgot about that scene at the end! Just got some details for the movie summary, and it mentions that. I guess that was one year later.	mai ant ka seen bilkul bhul gayamoive ki summary milne par laga yah yek saal bad
What did you think of the part when the case  went to the Supreme Court?	jab case superme court me tha us part ke bare me kya socha
Honestly, I really liked all of the scenes with Jesse Plemons as the lawyer. I thought he nailed it as far as lawyers taking a straight line even when something outside the box comes up. I wondered if the lines he spoke were based on facts and actual testimony.	muje jesse plemons ke lawyer vale sabhi  seen pasand  ,muje lagta hai usne as sabi ceejo ko achi trah nibaya ,,muje achtray hua usaki boli sabi line actual fact par thi
It looks like we're all done here - thanks for chatting!	ise laga jaise hum hi bat kar rahe ho
I don't remember much about the lawyer. I just liked how the other newspapers picke dup the mantle to support the Post and Times.	mai  lawyer ke bare jayda nahi socha,maine keval yah socha dusre paper kasi support kare
Oh yeah, thanks!	oh ha thanks
Hello!	namaste!
hey, what's up	hey, kya ho raha hai
have you watched la la land before?	tumne pehle la la land dekhi hai?
Yes. I really appreciated how much thought went into the movie's title. I think it's really cool how it refers to Los Angeles, music, and having your head in the clouds all at once. It's really spectacular how they summed up so many elements of the movie in such a short title	Han, mein sach mein iss baat ki kadra karta hu ki iss film k title mein kitni soch lagayi hai. Mein sochta hu ki ye bohat cool hai ki ye film Los Angeles, snageet, aur apne sir badalon mein hone ka jikra ek sath karti hai.  Yah bohat shandar hai ki unhone itne sare tatvon ko ek sath shamil kar lia film k itne chhote title mein.
Have you seen it?	Kya tumne dekha hai?
yep -  i watched it because critics seemed to like it	han - meine usse dekha hai kyuki wah aalochakon ko achhi lagi
I agree with most of the critics in the paper	Mein zyadatar aalochakon k sath sehmat hu
Yes. I especially agree with the review that La La Land is successful at showing the hardships that are involved with chasing a dream	Han. Mein uss review se khaaskar sehmat hu jismein kaha hai ki La La Land sapno k peeche bhaagne par aaney wali pareshaniyon ko dikhane mein safal huyi
I disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull and that the middle was boring. I really found the entire movie to be enthralling. 	mein disgree hu dono reviews se ki film dull hai or middle boring tha.  Mujhe really puri movie enthralling lagi
yep, i agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack, since they're not singers	Yep, mein aapse agree hu - mujhe believe hai humko emma stone and ryan gosling kuch slack hai, kyuki woh singers nahi hai
Agreed. I really liked the scene where Sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing Christmas music only. 	Mujhe really woh scene pasand aaya jaha Sebastian jazz music play kiya, jaha usne sirf christmas music play kar raha hai
It was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after I watched the movie	Yeh un scenes mein se ek hai jo movie dekhne ke baad mere se stuck ho gaye
would you do that, if you were in his position?	aap yesa karte, if aap uski position mein hote
I'm not sure. I liked how that was when Mia first heard Sebastian sing and was truly moved by it. I think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship	I'm not sure, mujhe accha laga jab Mia ne pheli baar Sebastian ka gana suna aur kaise woh truly moved ho gayi. I think yeh unka relationship start karne ka interesting way hai
yeah, it was just sad how he brushed her off, since things could've been different	Yeah, yeh sad hai usne kaise brush kiya, kyuki things different ho sakti thi
I do like how the next time Mia sees Sebastian he is also singing. I also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing	Mujhe accha laga next time Mia, Sebastian ko dekthi hai waih bhi gaa raha hai. Mujhe yeh bhi accha laga ki woh kaise unko ek song ka request karke tease kar rahi hai jabki woh janti hai woh gaane se hate karta hai
do you usually watch musicals?	tum usually musicals dekhte ho
Occasionally. I also enjoyed the development of Sebastian and Mia's relationship, such as when Mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because Sebastian suggests it to her. I feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship	Occasionally, mujhe Sbesatian aur Mia ke relationship ka development accha laga, jaise Mia se decide kiya apne aap se play write karne ka kyuki Sebastian ne usko suggest kiya.  Mujhe yesa feel hua dono jab grow hue jab wo relationship mein aaye
I enjoyed that part too, since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams	maine bhi wo part enjoy kiya, isme ye bhi dikhaya gaya hai kaise dono mehnat karte hai apne dreams achieve karne
they both want to become successful in their separate areas, but they have to struggle a lot	dono apne separate areas mein kamiyaab hona chahte hai,lekin unhe bahut struggle karna hai
Right. I feel like the review that mentions the cruelty that's involved in following your dreams really sums it up. The film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big	sahi. mujhe lagta hai review jisme zulm ka zikar hai tumhaare khawaab puray karne wo bahut acha sum up kiya hai. film darti nahi hai ye dikhaane ke kitne mehnat aur hardship lagti hai kuch bada karne
i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keith's offer	mujhe bhi laga sebastian  ko keith ka offer lene mushkil hui
i mean, he gets paid, but it's not something he wants to do. This happens in life a lot	mera matlab hai, usko pay mila lekin wo ye nahi karna chahta. Life mein aisa bahut hota hai
I agree. It must be hard to do something you're not passionate about- especially when it's something you must do in order to one day live out your dreams	main maanta hoon. aap jiske baare main passionate nahi hai,wo karna mushkil hai-especially jub wo kuch aisa hai jo aap ko karna hota hai ek din apne dreams puray karne
What did you think of the scene when Mia and Sebastian get into a fight about Mia thinking Sebastian is giving up on his dreams?	us scene ke baare mein aap ka kya khayal hai jub Mia aur Sebastian  ka jhagda hota hai aur Mia  samajhti hai Sebastian is giving up on his dreams?
it was definitely well acted, and i sympathize with both of them	ye yaqeenan well acted tha aur mujhe dono se sympathy hai
but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful	lekin shayad sebastian harsh tha jub usne kaha ke mia uskozyada pasand karti thi jub wo unsuccessful tha
It truly was heartbreaking when Mia moved back home to Nevada	sach mein bahut  heartbreaking tha jub Mia wapis apne ghar Nevada chale jaati hai
i feel he didn't want to hear the truth, because he was really giving up on his dreams	Mujhe lagta hai wo sach nahi sunna chahta kyunki wo apne sapno ko chod raha hai.
it really was sad	Wo sach mein sad tha.
I agree. It was also a very unpredictable plot twist. I did not see it coming at all	Main bhi maanta hun ki unpredictable twist tha kahani mein jiska bilkul andaza nahi tha.
would you say that was the low point in the movie?	Kya tum maante ho ki wo kahani ka low point tha ?
Yes but I wouldn't say any part of the movie "sagged badly" as one review claims	Haan but mujhe nahi lagta ki movie ka koi bhi part sagged badly tha jaisa ki ek review ne claim kiya tha.
i agree - overall, i would recommend the movie to a friend	Main bhi maanta hun and main apne friend ko movie zaroor recommend karunga.
I agree. As another review points out it was a "genuinely romantic comedy", which I completely agree with because I feel as though Sebastian and Mia's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies. I appreciated the realness of their relationship	Main maanta hun ki movie genuinely romantic comedy thi jaise ki ek aur reviewer ne point out kiya kyunki mujhe lagta hai jaise Sebastian aur Mia ka relationship itna cliche nahi tha jitna dusri love stories mein hota hai. Mujhe unki relationship ki sachai achi lagi.
yes, that was one thing i loved about the movie - while it was sad, it was not a cliche ending	Haan, Movie ki wo ek cheez achi thi chahe wo sad thi par wo ek cliche ending nahi thi.
I agree. I think Damien Chazelle really did a good job directing the film. 	Main bhi agree karta hun ki Damien Chazelle ne film directing ka bahut acha kaam kiya hai.
i'm curious, are you an ai	Mujhe utsukta ho rahi, kya aap ai hain ?
if so, i was completely fooled	agar aisa hai to i was fooled
I am not! 	main nahi hoon
But I really was surprised that someone reviewed Sebastian as a "jazz snob" because I did not get that vibe at all	lekin main bohat surprised tha ki kisine Sebastaian ko 'jazz snob' review kia kyunki mujhe aisi vibe nahi aati
yeah, i disagreed with that characterization, but i can see why someone might say that.	han mujhe bhi disagree hua is characterization se, lekin main samajh sakta hun kisine aisa kyun kaha hoga
he is a purist, or whatever they called it in the film	wo ek purist hai, ya fir jo be usey movie mein bulaya gaya
I also really didn't think Mia's character lacked depth. I think she was a rather round character, especially with the large amount of independence she possessed. It took a lot of courage for her to move back to Nevada	mujhe ye bhi nahi lagta ki Mia ke character mein depth ki kami thi. Mujhe lagta hau uska characted kafi round tha, khaaskar jis large amount mein uske paas independence thi. Use Nevada waapis move karne mein kafi courage laga.
yes, i thought her character was pretty nuanced, but i'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to Nevada. After the play didn't go well, I think that was her only option	han mujhe laga uska character kafi nuanced tha lekin main sure nahi hun ki kya Nevada wpas jaana courageous tha. Play kharab jaane ke baad mujhe lagta hai uske paas sirf yahi option tha.
*about it	uske baare me
I suppose you have a point. I just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didn't cling on to Sebastian when things didn't work out for her. 	aapke pas point hai. Mujhe lagta hai wo films mein portray ki jaane wali average woman se zyada independent thu kyunki jab uska kaam sahi nahi bana to usne Sebastian ko cling nahi kia.
although I wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams	lekin main chahta tha ki wo apne dreams achieve karne se pehle reconcile ho jaate
the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad	end me jo dikhaya tha, wah mujhe actually kafi sad kar sakta tha
I agree! It was very sad but also, as one reviewer puts it quite "bittersweet." I wasn't sure how to feel at the end. 	I agree! ki wah bhi bahut sad tha, jaise ek reviewer ne kaha hai yah kafi "bittersweet" hai, mai sure nahi tha ki end mai kaisa feel karu.
It was nice discussing the film with you! Have a great day!	tumhare sath film discuss karna nice tha! have a great day!
you guys have a pretty good ai system	tum logo ke pass kafi badhiya ai system hai
i was actually completely fooled	mai actually complete fool ban gaya tha.
Hi there!	hi
I haven't seen Bruce Almighty for some reason, but I do love Jim Carrey.	mein bruce almighty ko nahi dekha kuch reason ke liye, lekin muej jim carrey pasand hein
I haven't seen this one either, but I have heard that it is pretty funny.	mein bhi nahi dekha, lekin mein sunna hoon ki voh jyada funny hein
It's a pretty great idea. I'm sure it's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but he is really funny and so is Morgan Freeman.	yeh tho badiya idea hein. muje nahi lagtha ki yeh unka greatest movies mein yek hein, kyon ki voh itna funny hein jaise morgan freeman ke tarah
Jennifer Aniston annoys me a little though, I gotta say	jeenifer aniston tho muje bahut annoys karti aur mein bolne hi vaali thi
I really do like Morgan Freeman, most of his movies are good. I think I might have to check this one out.	Main sahi mein Morgan Freeman ko pasand krta huin, uski bahut si movies achhi hain. Mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe isse bhi dekhna chahiye.
I look at Rotten Tomatoes a lot for movie ratings though, and 48% is pretty low. It has been out for a while, though.	Haanlanki main rotton tomatoes ko dekhta huin movie ratings check krne ke liye, aur 48% bahut kam hai. Haanlanki ye bahut dair se bahar hai.
 I don't know why, but she has annoyed me through the years too. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, I just don't really like her very much.	Mujhe nhi pta kyu, but usne mujhe saalon se pareshaan kiya hai. Main apni finger iss par nhi daal sakta ki yeh kya hai, sach mein main use bahut pasand nhi karta.
 Yes, it has been out for quite some time. Maybe it's on Netflix.	Han, kafi samay se bahar hai. Shayad ye Netflix pe bhi hai.
Do you like comedies like this, or are you more into dramas?	Kya tumhe aisi comedies pasand hai, ya tum tumhe dramas zyada pasand hai?
 My favorite movie genre is science fiction, but I do like a good comedy, or a good drama. If it's a good movie, I really don't care what genre it is.	Meri favorite movie genre hai science fiction, but mujhe acchi comedy bhi acchi lagti hai, ya achha drama. Agar ye ek acchi movie hai, to main asal mein parwaah nhi krti ki ye kis genre ki hai.
That's true. The first review under the "critical response" section is pretty harsh. I'm not sure I really ever read or care about movie reviews, just the ratings % online	Yeh sahi hai. "critical response" section ka pehla review bahut harsh hai. Main sure nhi huin main movie reviews padhne ya itni parwaah nhi krta, sirf online % ratings
 When looking at movie reviews, I put more faith in actual regular people that go see the movie then I do official critics.	Jab movie reviews dekhte, main faith official critics se zyada asal regular logo pe dekhta huin jo movie dekh kar aaye hain
True. Looking at the Key Scenes, I feel like the plot might have been a little paint-by-numbers and relying on Jim Carrey's personality too much, which is probably why it wasn't better recieved.	Sahi. Key Scenes ko dekhte hai, to mujhe lagta hai ki plot thoda paint-by-numbers aur Jim Carrey ki personality pe bahut zyada nirbhar hai, shayad issi wajah hai ki better nhi mila.
 Yes, I can I didn't get that impression.	Han, main kar skta huin mujhe achha impression nhi mila.
 Sorry, this is supposed to say that I did get that impression.	Sorry, ye kahana chahiye ki mujhe vah aabhas mila
I guess that's part of his appeal, he can take any kind of material and make it funny. Also Steve Carrell is a great, funny actor too and I can see him being a good villian.	mujhe lagata hai ki ye unki appeal ka hissa hai, vah kisi bhi tarah ka material leke aur use funny bana sakate he. sath hi Steve Carrell ek mahaan, funny actor bhi hain aur main unhe ek achchha villian bhi dekh sakta hu.
 Yes, he is pretty good in everything he does.	Ha, vah apane har kaam mein bahut achchhe hai.
I haven't even heard of Metacritic or CinemaScore, to be honest. But it's weird that it's 46/100 on Metacritic and and A on CinemaScore. Those are pretty different scores.	Maine bhi Metacritic ya Cinemascore pramanik hone ke bare mein nahin suna hai. lekin yah ajib hai ki yah Metacritic par 46/100 hai aur Cinemascore pe A hai. yah bahut alag scores hain.
 That's true, I'm not sure how they score these things.	yah sach hai, mujhe yakin nahin hai ki ve in chijo ko kaise score karte hai.
The part where he creates the email system to answer prayers and sets it to auto-reply "yes" is pretty funny and says a lot about religion.	vah hissa jaha vah prarthanao ka javab dene ke liye email system banata hai aur ise auto-reply "haa" ke liye set karata hai vah bahut hi majedar hai aur dhharm ke bare me bahut kuchh kahata hai.
 Sounds pretty funny, I will have to put it on my list.	Bahut majedar lagata hai, mujhe ise apane list mein rakhana hoga.
I do think maybe some of the scenes they describe with Jimmy Hoffa's body sound cheesy. I'm not sure!	Mujhe lagata hai ki sayad Jimmy Hoffa ki body sound ke saath kuchh drashyon ka varnan hai. main sure nahin hu!
 I agree with that statement.	Main usse sahamat hu
I do think if I had the power of being God I'd use it for better things!	mujhe lagata hai ki agar mere paas God hone ki shakti hoti to main isaka istemal behtar chijon ke liye karata
 For sure!	for sure
Interesting. I mean, the way the rest of the plot wraps up seems pretty standard.	Interesting. I mean baaki jaise plot wrap up hote hai kaafi standard lagta hai
 I agree, however, it might be worth a watch.	I agree, but ek time watch worth ho sakti hai
The best part of the movie is probably the middle section where he's testing out all of his powers. Seems like the end might be disappointing based on this description.	Movie ka best part probably middle section hai jaha wo apni sari power test karta hai. Aisa lagta hai k end description k basis pe disappointing ho sakta hai
 I'm not the hugest Jim Carrey fan, but I'll give it a try.	Main Jim Carrey ka bada fan to nahi hu , but main ek try karunga
Yeah I think he is so out-there that this is a perfect film for him.	Haan mujhe lagta hai k wo aise bahar hai k ye film uske liye perfect hai
 Yeah, he always seems to play some crazy out-of-control guy.	Haan wo hamesha koi crazy out of control aadmi play karta hai
hi	hi

Hello, what's the name of the movie?	HELLO, MOVIE KA NAM KAY HAI?
Hi, it's the Imitation Game	HI, WO the Imitation Game HAI
Does it seem interesting?	kay wo interesting lag rahi  hai?
Definitely, it takes place during WWII and it's decrypting spy code messages	jaroor, ye sab during WWII huva tha or it's decrypting spy code messages
Cool, is there a main lead actor or actress that's easily identifiable?	cool, kay us me main leaf actor or actress easily identifiable hai
Yes, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly, it's got a pretty good score on Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore.	ha, iss me  Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly hai, is co accha score mila hai Tomatoes and CinemaScore pe
Good to know, what studio is it produced by?	good to know, kis studio ne isse produce kiya hai?
I'm not sure about that but did you know there was an earlier movie about the same book?	Muze nahi pata uske bareme , per tum ko pata hai kay there was an earlier movie about the same book?
So  it's based on a book?	to, ye kitap be based hai?
Yes, it's based on Alan Turing:  The Enigma and the earlier movie was called Breaking the Code, it was on BBC.	yes, ye based hai Alan Turing: The Enigma or pehele ki movie ka nam tha  Breaking the Code, wo BBC pe thi
Good to know, although I didn't ask; does it say who starred in the BBC version?	jaanakaar achchha laga, haalaanki mainne poochha nahin; kya yah kahana hai ki BBC sanskaran mein kisane abhinay kiya
No, but I've got info on a few of the key scenes if you're interested in knowing?	nahin, lekin mujhe kuchh pramukh drshyon kee jaanakaaree milee hai yadi aap jaanane mein ruchi rakhate hain?
Absolutely, are the scenes taken from the book, the BBC version, or the movie?	poorn roop se, pustak se lie gae drshy hain, BBC sanskaran, ya philm?
From the 2014 movie with Cumberbatch and Knightley.  The earliest scene has Turing in boarding school being bullied, and he makes a friend there that gets him interested in cryptography.	2014 kee philm se kambarabaich aur naitalee ke saath. shuruaatee drshy mein tyooring in bording skool ko badanaam kiya ja raha hai, aur vah vahaan ek dost banaata hai jo use kriptograaphee mein dilachaspee leta hai.
That's cool, so it's sort of a biographical movie?	yah achchha hai, to yah ek jeevanee philm kee tarah hai?
The next scene is when Britain declares war on Germany, Turing goes to work at a place called Bletchley Park that is trying to decode the Nazi's Enigma Machine.  Yes, it's a historical drama.	agala drshy hai jab briten ne jarmanee par yuddh kee ghoshana kee, tyooring ek jagah par kaam karane jaata hai jise bailechale paark kaha jaata hai vah naajee kee pahelee masheen ko dikod karane kee koshish kar raha hai. haan, yah ek aitihaasik naatak hai.
Do you want to hear the plot?	kya aap kathaanak sunana chaahate hain?
Does it mention how accurate the movie is as opposed to real-life events; that's why I was asking if it was biographical as opposed to simply historical?	kya yah ullekh karata hai philm vaastavik jeevan kee ghatanaon ke vipareet kitanee sahee hai; isalie main poochh raha tha yadi yah keval aitihaasik ke vipareet jeevanee thee?
Oh.  One of the critics says it rearranges the time sequences and invents fictional characters.  	oh. ek aalochak kahata hai yah samay drshyon ko punarvyavasthit karata hai aur kaalpanik paatron ko laagoo karata hai.
Thanks for the clarification , are there any more excerpts?	spashteekaran ke lie dhanyavaad, kya koee aur ansh hain?
Yes, the plot sounds really good.  Turing manages to decrypt the Nazi code machine, but the Nazis change the code every day.  So they all realize they can't act on every day's decrypted messages or the Nazis will know that their code machine is useless.	haan, kathaanak vaastav mein achchha lagata hai. tyooring naajee kod masheen ko dikript karane ka prabandhan karata hai, lekin naajiyon ne har din kod badal diya. isalie ve sabhee mahasoos karate hain ki ve har din dikript kie gae sandeshon par kaam nahin kar sakate hain ya naajiyon ko pata chal jaega ki unakee kod masheen bekaar hai.
Interesting, does it mention how it's resolved, or does it leave you sort of on the cliff?	dilachasp hai, yah ullekh karata hai ki yah kaise hal ho gaya hai, ya kya yah aapako chattaan par chhodata hai?
It kind of leaves a cliffhanger there.  There are a couple of twists, though.	yah vahaan ek kliphanar ko chhod deta hai. haalaanki kuchh jode hain.
Does it say whether the main characters survive to the end, or are they wounded, etcetera?	kya yah kahata hai ki kya mukhy paatr ant tak jeevit rahate hain, ya ve ghaayal hote hain, vagairah?
It doesn't tell.  One of the twists in the plot is that a Russian spy is discovered by Turing.  Which isn't surprising at first, but then we find out that British intelligence planted him to tell the Russians secrets they wanted them to know, after all Russia and Great Britain were on the same side in WWII.	yah nahin bataata. saajish mein ek tvist yah hai ki tyooring dvaara ek roosee jaasoos kee khoj kee jaatee hai. yah pahalee baar mein aashcharyachakit karane vaala nahin hai, lekin phir hamen pata chala ki british khuphiya ne unhen roos ke rahasyon ko bataane ke lie lagaaya tha, jo ve jaanana chaahate the, aakhirakaar roos aur gret briten wwii mein ek hee taraph the.
That's sort of a twisted narrative of the political situation, but whatever, anything else super useful or interesting, (it sounds like a great movie)?	yah raajaneetik sthiti ke ek mod kee tarah hai, lekin jo kuchh bhee, supar upayogee ya dilachasp hai, (yah ek mahaan philm kee tarah lagata hai)?
When I watched the movie, I liked the codebreaking machine they had,  It was this massive technical looking wall that was way before the time of WWII.  Yes, there's another twist in the plot where the Russian spy threatens to tell everyone that Turing is homosexual.	jab mainne philm dekhee, to mujhe unake paas kodabreking masheen pasand aaee, yah is vishaal takaneekee dikhane vaalee deevaar thee jo wwii ke samay se pahale thee. haan, saajish mein ek aur mod hai jahaan roosee jaasoos ne sabhee ko yah bataane kee dhamakee dee ki tyooring samalaingik hai.
How did the spy know that Turing was gay?	jaasoos ko kaise pata chala ki tyooring samalaingik tha?
Turing told the spy, because Turing was about to get married to Clarke (Knightley).  It sounds like high drama to me.  The spy (before Turing realized he was a spy) told Turing to keep his homosexuality a secret.  I guess they were pretty tight.	tyooring ne jaasoos ko bataaya, kyonki tyooring kee shaadee klaark (naitalee) se hone vaalee thee. yah mujhe uchch naatak kee tarah lagata hai. jaasoos (tyooring se pahale ehasaas hua ki vah ek jaasoos tha) ne tyooring ko apanee samalaingikata ko gupt rakhane ke lie kaha tha. mujhe lagata hai ki ve bahut tang the.
Wow, that's a big ol' ball of secrecy for that time period, is there anything else about the plot or whatever you should tell me?	vaah, yah us samay kee avadhi ke lie ek badee raajabhaasha gopaneeyata kee gend hai, kya saajish ke baare mein kuchh aur hai ya jo kuchh bhee aapako mujhe bataana chaahie?
Yes, at the end of the movie, the Allies win the war and the boss makes the cryptographers promise to never see each other again and they destroy all the code.  Also, Turing tells Clarke (Knightley) to leave because he is scared for her safety.  He tells her he is gay and that he never cared for her, which wasn't true because he was in love with her.	haan, philm ke ant mein, mitr raashtr yuddh jeetata hai aur bos kriptograaphars ko ek doosare ko phir kabhee nahin dekhane ka vaada karata hai aur ve sabhee kod ko nasht kar dete hain. isake alaava, tyooring klaark (naitalee) ko chhodane ke lie kahata hai kyonki vah usakee suraksha ke lie darata hai. vah usase kahata hai ki vah samalaingik hai aur usane kabhee usakee paravaah nahin kee, jo sach nahin tha kyonki vah usake saath pyaar mein thee.
It got a pretty good score on Rotten Tomatoes.	roten tomaatoz par ise bahut achchha skor mila.
What's the rotten tomatoes score?	sada hua tamaatar skor kya hai?
Rotten Tomatoes is 91%, CinemaScore is A+, and Metacritic Score is a bit low at 73/100.	roten tomaatoz 91% hai, sinemaaskor e + hai, aur metaakritik skor 73/100 par thoda kam hai.
Hmm, not bad at all, does it say when it was released?	hamm, bilkul bhee bura nahin hai, yah kahata hai ki yah kab jaaree kiya gaya tha?
I think that about does it for this movie, do you think you'll see it?	mujhe lagata hai ki is philm ke baare mein kya aapako lagata hai ki aap ise dekhenge?
in 2014	2014 mein
It sounds really good, more likely than not, I will; how about you?	yah vaastav mein achchha lagata hai, adhik sambhaavana nahin hai, main karoonga; aap kaise hain?
I didn't realize I had already seen it until I started reading this.  I remember it was really good.  If a movie isn't good I usually don't recall it this clearly.	I didn't realize I had already seen it until I started reading this. I remember it was really good. If a movie isn't good I usually don't recall it this clearly.
It was definitely a good look into what life was like during that horrible war.  It's been good chatting with you, I enjoyed.	us bhayaanak yuddh ke dauraan jeevan kaisa tha, yah nishchit roop se achchha tha. yah aapake saath achchhee chaiting hai, mujhe maza aaya.
Lol, likewise, I'm pretty sure we just do the exit survey at this point and tell them whether we want to see the movie, right? 	yogy, isee tarah, mujhe poora yakeen hai ki ham sirph is bindu par baahar nikalane ka sarvekshan karenge aur unhen bataenge ki kya ham philm dekhana chaahate hain, hai na?
Hi are you ready to get started? This is a batman vs superman superhero crossover movie. Are you familiar with those superheroes?	Hi kya tum shuru krne ke liye tyaar ho? Yeh batman vs superman ek superhero crossover movie hai. Kya tum inn superheroes ko jante ho?
We are here to discuss Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice	Hum yahan Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice ko discuss karenge
Yes i am familar with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard of	Han mujhe inn cahracters ke baare mein pta hai but kuch actors ke baare mein maine kabhi sunna nhi
I think it sounds like an amazing movie. I love superheroes. I think some of the critics are too harsh. It was a good plot line. I am familiar with Ben Affleck but none of the others. 	Mujhe lagta hai ki yeh ek bahut achhi movie hai. Mujhe superheroes bahut pasand hai. Yeh achhi plot line thi. Main Ban Affleck ke baare mein jaanta huin but bake kisi ke baare mein nhi.
I wish they would have used more famous people. 	Kaash unhone zyada famous logo ko liya hota.
I would agree though that it was not as good as man of steel. The plot line of that was amazing!	Main sehmat huin jabki woh man of steel jitni achhi nhi hai. Uski plot line bahut badiya thi!
Ben Affleck is the only actor I recognize great plot very harsh critcs	Ben Affleck hi sirf ek aisa actor hai jise main pehnchanta huin achha plot bhut harsh critics
I agree. I didn't completely understand why Batman and Superman fought though. 	I agree, mujhe theek se samajh nahi aaya ki Batman and Superman kyun lad rahe the
Rotten Tomatoes list it as 27%and average with a 4.9 out of 10. The critcs must be weird. Yeah i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad	Rotten Tomatoes par 27% hai and average 4.9 hai 10 mein se. Critics bahut ajeeb hain. Mujhe fight samajh nahi aayi par mujhe lagta hai ki Superman ne galti se Bruce Wayne ke Dad ko maar diya tha.
I thought it was worth a meteoritic score more than 44. That seemed low! That makes sense. I would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my family members. 	Mujhe laga ki movie ka Meteoritic score 44 se jyada hai. Yeh toh kam hai! Par sense karta hai. Mujhe bhi bahut gussa ayega agar kisi ne mere family waalon ko maar diya.
hello?	Haan?!
Yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of Lex Luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole movie. I like how the critic talked about Lex (who is supermans arch enemy ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler (who are batmans arch enemies	Haan mujhe bhi, saath mein Lex ke character ka unique spin hai aur voh bus spiral down karta hai poori movie mein. Joh critics ne Lex (joh Superman ka arch enemy hai) ke baare mein bola, voh mujhe accha laga, kyunki unhone Lex ko Joker and Riddler ke saath compare kiya.
Then he tops off the crazy part by comparing him to Mark Zuckerburg. 	Aur fir voh pagalon jaise usko Mark Zuckerburg se compare karne laga.
Ohh. I liked that too. I like how they always try to biring in the government official s	Ohh, voh mujhe bhi accha laga. Mujhe accha laga ki they always bring in government officials.
Yeah im still here just slow typer	Yeah, meri typing slow hai, I'm still here.
Do you like batman or superman better in the movie?	Tujhe jyada accha kaun laga, Batman or Superman iss movie mein?
Actually superman 	Actually Superman.
How bout u	tumhare regarding  kya vichar he
I grew up watching the justice league cartoons in thelate 70s and early 80s in which alll the superheros worked together.	70 aur early 90s Me, me Cartoon JUstice League dekhte hue grew up hua jisame all super hero milkar work karte he.
I love batman	mujhe batman se love he
He is so mysterious 	vo bahut mysterious he
Sorta ironic that they become enemies 	ye bada ironic he ki ve enemies ban jate he
Yes he is very mysterious	ha vo bada mysterious he
It is. Its not what I expected at all	it is.ye to mene bilkul bhi expect nahi kiya tha
I expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together 	iske bajay , me to Avenger ki try expect kar raha tha where heroes ka bunch together work karta he.
I don't really like that they are enimies	mujhe unka ememies hona really pasand nahi aaya.
Especially to the point where batman was going to kill superman 	Especially us point par jahan Batman, Superman ko kill karne ja raha tha.
Me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent was trying to make bruce wayne and batman look bad thru his news articles	mujhe bhi par pretty much superman ne ye start kiya article kehta hai clark kent apne news articles se bruce wayne aur batman ko bad dikhane ki try kar raha tha
You know though to be honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies. 	kya tum jante ho to be honest agar tum dekho world ajkal kis way ka hai full of bad to world view mein unhe enemies ki tarah hona perfect sense banata hai
I guess so. They do have polar opposite personalities. One is a humble farm boy and the other is a rich executive 	Main aisa hi guess karta hun. Un dono ki polar opposite personalities hain. Ek humble farmboy hau aur dusra rich executive hai.
I could see why they clash in that aspect, but I guess I don't imagine them interacting very much in superhero world. 	Main samajh sakta hun us aspect mein unhone kyun clash kiya, par I guess main unhe superhero world mein zaya interact karte nahi dekhta.
It says in the 3rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce way e apol9gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman	ye 3rd part mein kehte hai ki superman ke funera mein bruce wayne apologise karta hai lois lane ko ki he failed superman
DUUHHHH well yeah he failed him if he killed him lol	DUUHHHH well haan agar usne usey maar diya to he failed him
I would feel like if I failed someone if I let them die too. Haha. I like the mysterious dirt levitating though 	mujhe bhi lagega ki I failed someone agar main unhe marne de dun. Haha. Mujhe mysterious dirt levitating kafi acha laga.
Haha 	haha
Thats what I was thinking 	main bhi yahi soch raha tha
Little humor there	yaha thoda humor hai
Have u seen this movie 	aap is movie ko dekha
No have you? is that the end?	nahi yar.. aap? aur end kya hein?
I can't tell	mein batha nahi sakthi
Oh yeah. It is.	acha..
I wonder if there will be a sequel 	agar voh sequel hota
Yes watched it 3 times its a tearjerker for me when superman dies	haan, mein tho 3 baar dekh chuka hoon, voh tearjerker tha mere liye jab superman ka moth huva
I feel like good superhero movies need sequels 	muje tho superhero movies mein sequels pasand hein
I dunno could be a sequel 	sequel tho muje patha bhi nahi
Like how superman didnt really die he just hibernated til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman	asal mein tho superman nahi martha voh batman ke role ko hibernated kiya
hello	hello
Hi	hi
I can’t seem to see what the movie is	Mujhe ye movie kya hai dikh nahi rahi

Got good reviews on rotten tomatoes but a poor score on Metacritic	Rotten Tomatoes pe to acche review hai but Metacritic pe bekaar score hai
Genre not really my cup of tea.	Ye Genre mujhe khas pasand nahi.
you there?	tum vaha ho?
hello hello hello is anybody out there?	namaste namaste  namaste kya bahar koi hai?

Hello! Isn't Monsters University a great movie? It was true to the spirit of Monsters, Inc. and matched its tone. 	namste, monster university ek badia movie lagti hai na? monster ki aatam aur soch se bilkul meel khati hai
I agree.  It was a good movie	main sehmat hoon, vo ik achi movie thi.
What was your favorite part?	kaun sa part tumhe acha lagga?
I liked when Mike and Sully didn't finish the program and worked their way up the ranks anyways.	muje acha lagga jab mike aur ully ne program khatam nahi kiya aur phir bhi mehnat se tarraki ki
Me too! It was very inspiring and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways. I liked how the movie expanded on the monster world. 	meje bhi veh ik parerna thi aur darshata tha ki tum apne khawab pure kar sakte ho, jaisa movie ne batae monster world main muje vo acha lagga
Yes.  The first movie only gave one facet of the world, while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree.	haan. pehli movie main sirk ik hissa dikha tha tha us duniya ka jab ki dusri ne sathapna kaafi had tak kar di
When I heard they were making another Monsters Inc movie I expected a sequel, not a prequel. But I ended up loving it! Did you see it in theatres?	jab maine sunna k vo ik aur monsters inc move bana rahe hai mainse uska agla hissa samja jab ki vi usse peche ki kahani hai. par muje acha lagga . kya tumne theater main dekhi thi.
I don't think we saw it in the theatre.  I think we rented it.  It's been a while though.  I should show it to my kids.  They would probably like it.	muje nahi lagta humne theater main dekhi thi. shayad hume kiraye pe li thi. kaafi samma ho gaya. main ajarur  apne bachon ko dikhaunga
I bet they would! I don't have kids but my coworkers do. I love Disney/Pixar movies so I recommend them to my coworkers a lot. 	main sharat lagata hun k vo! mere koi bache nahi hai par sath kam karne vaale hain muje disney/pixer movie pasand hai isiliye main apne sath karne valon ko batata hun.
I really enjoy Randy Newman's music on this, the Toy Story movies, and Finding Nemo/Dory.	muje randy newman's ka sangeet uspe acha lagga toy stories aur finding nemo/dory
Me too! I think the Toy Story movies might be my favorite Pixar movies. Did you hear that they're building a Toy Story Land in Walt Disney World this summer? 	Mujhe bhi! I think Toy story movies meri favorite Pixar movie hogi. Kya tumne suna wo Toy story Land bana rahe hain Walt Disney World mein this summer?
I did hear that.  It sounds pretty interesting.  	Haan maine suna hai. Bahut interesting hoga.
I'm going to WDW in the fall so I'm excited to see how the park is. Have you ever been? Or to Disneyland?	MAin fall season mein WDW jaa raha hoon isliye excited hoon park dekhne ke liye. Kya tum kbhi gaye ho? Ya Disneyland gaye ho?
I've been to WDW a few times.  Never to Disneyland though.  California is pretty far away from me.  We went camping at WDW last year though.  It was great.	Main WDW ek-aadh baar gaya hoon. Disneyland nahee gaya kabhi. California bahoot door hai. Humlog WDW mein camping gaye the pichhle saal.
That's what I'm doing in the fall! I'm really looking forward to camping there!	Wahee to main kar rahaa hoon is fall mein! Main to intezar kar raha hoon wahaan camping ka!
It was really great.  We camped for four nights I think.  It rained like crazy the first day, but it was still fun.	Bahut maza aaya tha. Humlog four nights camp kiye the. First day bhayanak baarish hui thi, but fir bhi fun tha.
Do you like Mike or Sulley better?	Tumhe Mike ya Sulley kaun better lagta hai?
Oh good question! I think I like Mike more. He's weirdly optimistic. 	Oh achchhaa sawaal! Mujhe lagta hain ki main Mike ko zyada pasand karta hoon. Wo weirdly optimistic hai.
How about you?	Aur tumhe?
I like Mike because he's funnier.  He had some of the best lines in the first movie.	Mujhe Mike pasand kyunki wo zyada funny hai. First movie mein uski lines best thee.
He is SO funny!! 	Wo kafi funny hai
I always liked John Goodman's voice acting for Sully, though. It's perfect for a big, fluffy monster	Halaki mujhe Sully mai John Goodman ki voice acting hamesha aachi lagi. Ye bade, fuffy monster ke liye perfect hai
The part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard.	Pehli movie ke end mai jab wo muh se microphone nikalta hai, usse mere bacche bohot zor se haste hein.
I agree. John Goodman was a great choice for Sulley.	mai agree karta hun. John Goodman Sulley ke liye behtareen choice tha.
Hahah I bet!!! 	hahah shart lagata hun!
I love the scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest. That was pretty neat	mujhe prequel mai wo darane wali machine pasand hai jise students ko darana tha contest ke liye. Wo kafi saaf tha.
Yeah, though I was really disappointed with Sulley for cheating.	han, halaki mai bohot niraash tha Sulley ke cheating karne se
I was too, that broke my heart. I cried when that happened!	mai bhi tha, usne mera dil tod diya. Mai roya jab wo hua!
It was really a cruel thing for him to do to MIke	Ye bohot cruel tha jo Mike ke upar kiya gya
It seemed a little out of character for Sulley, but I guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving.	Ye Sulley ke character se alag lga, par mujhe lagta hai unhe ek aakhiri conflict ka source chahiye tha un dono ke beech plot ko chalate rehne ke liye.
I agree, it was probably my least favorite part of the movie. I feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction.	MEIN MAANTHA HOON, YEH THO MERA LEAST FAVORITE PART HEIN IS MOVIE MEIN... MUJE LAGTHA HEIN, KI IS STORY KO ALAG DIRECTION MEIN LEKHE GAYA HEIN
For Sully to trick Mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful! 	SULLY NEI MIKE KO TRICK KAR RAHI THI KI VOH SCARY HEIN, JO BAHUT HURT FUL HEIN
I do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams though.  That's a good message that Disney started doing with the Princess and the Frog.	MUJE UNKA DREAM KO ACHIEVE KARNE KE LIYE UNKA WORK BAHUT PASAND HEIN... DISNEY KA ACHE MESSAGE HEIN, VOH THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG SE SHURU KIYE
Me too! I like that common thread between the two movies. I think it was executed better in this though, because they really did start from the very bottom of Monsters, Inch	MUJE BHI! MUJE UNKA COMMON THREAD US MOVIES KE BETWEEN PASAND HEIN... KUCH BETTER EXECUTE KIYE HEIN, KYON KI VOH MONSTERS KA BOTTOM SE SHURU HUVA
And it explains why they're always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie.  They were once in that same position.	AUR VOH EXPLAIN KARTHE KI KYON VOH JANITORS KE SAATH ACHE HEIN IN ORIGINAL MOVIE MEIN.. SAB SAM POSITION MEIN THEY
Oh my gosh!!! I didn't even realize that! I have to rewatch the movie. You're totally right!	OMG! MUJE REALIZE HI NAHI HUVA! MEIN DUBARA DEKHNA PASAND KARUNGI..
It does show a really good message for kids, to be respectful of everybody	KIDS KE LIYE THO ACHE MESSAGE HEIN, KITNA RESPECTFUL HEIN VOH SABKE SAATH
It's a valuable message.  Be kind and respectful to everyone.  Don't expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life.  Just be prepared to work your hardest.	VALUABLE MESSAGE HEI... SABHI KE LIYE THO KIND AUR RESPECTFUL HEIN.. CREDENTIALS AUR FAMILY REPUTATION KE LIYE THO KABHI LEAN MAT KARO..KAAM HARDEST KE LIYE SIRF ACHE SE PREPARE KARO
Yes! I liked that they showed Sully as this spoiled brat at first who eventually learned that you can't always lean on your family's reputation. It can only get you so far	HAAN, MUJE PEHELE SULLY KA SPOILED BRAT FIRST PASAND AAYA LEKIN EVENTUALLY JAB USSE LEARN KIYA KI FAMILY REPUTATION KELIYE KABHI LEAN NAHI KARNA CHAHIYE..
Maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition, because he didn't really realize the consequences of his actions, just did what he thought was right	MAYBE YEH USKA SPOILED BACKGROUND KE VAJE BHI HO SAKTHA, JO COMPETITION KE LIYE CHEAT KIYA HEIN.. KYONKI VOH ACTIONS KE CONSEQUENCES KO REALIZE HI NAHI HOTA,
I feel like a lot of kids need that message these days.	MUJE FEEL HOTA KI AAJKAL KAHI KIDS KO MESSAGE CHAHIYE
You've got a good point there about the cheating.	HAAN AAP SAHI HEIN, VOH CHEATING KE BAARE MEIN HEIN
And you have a good point there about kids needing that message!	AUR AAP SAHI HEIN, AAJ KAL KA KIDS KO KAAFI MESSAGE NEED HEIN
I like that they had to work hard together too, so it didn't feel like so much of a struggle. Because Mike and Sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder	MUJE UNKA WORK TOGETHER PASAND HEIN, LEKIN UNKA STRUGGLE ITNA BHI PASAND NAHI HEIN, KYONKI MIKE AUR SULLY THO AAPAAS MEIN APNE KAAM SHARE KARTEH JO CORPORATE KA LADDER ACHEIVE KARNE MEIN KAAM AATHA

Hi, I think you should watch LaLa Land. It sounds like it is an amazing movie	haay, mujhe lagata hai ki aapako laala laind dekhana chaahie. aisa lagata hai ki yah ek adbhut philm hai
Who stars in the movie?	Is movie mein stars kaun hai?
Ryan Gosling, Emma stone, and John Legend	Ryan Roseling, Emma Stne aur John Legend
I like Ryan Gosling. He is a good actor, but I heard that it was a musical. Is that correct?	Mujhe Ryan Roseling pasand hai. Woh ek achhe actor hai par maine suna hai yeh musical hai.Sahi hai kya?
Yes, it is a musical romatic comedy! It has the best off all the things that make you feel good! Romance,and comedy.	Haan. yeh  comedy . musical romantic Sabse acchi baat yeh hai ki , iame ramance aur comedy aapko accha feel karata hai.
I cannot imagine Ryan Gosling in a musical, but I guess it could work.	Mein Ryan Roseling ko musical movie mein soch hi nahi sakta lekin asha karta hoon ki yeh chal jaye.
Where does the movie take place?	Yeh movie kahan pe lee gayi hai.
He plays as the Jazz pianist, and he falls in love with Emma Stone. It takes place in Los Angeles. 	Woh ek jazz pianist ka role karte hai aur Emma stone se love karne lagte hain. Yeh Los Angeles mein lee gayi hai.
Is Emma Stone playing an artist also?	Kya Emma stone  bhi ek artist ka role nibha rahi hai?
She is a aspiting actress in this film. They are both pursuing their dreams. 	Woh ek akankshi actress ki role nibha rahi hai. Dono apne apne sapnon do sach karne mein lagte hai.
What part does John Legend play?	John Legend kaa role kya hai?
I am not sure what part he pays. In the first part Ryan Gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of I Ran (So far Away), he feels like the song is an isult for a serious musician	Mujhe sure nhi hai ki usne konsa part play kiya tha. Pehle part mein Ryan Gosling ek part pe tha or usne I ran (ab tak door) ka cover play kiya tha, wo song aisa lag rha tha ki ek serous musician ki insult ki ho.
What is the time period of the movie? Is it a modern story?	Movie ka time period kya hai? kay yeh ek modern story hai?
Yes I think it is modern time period	Han mujhe lagta hai ki modern time period hai
Have you seen the movie?	Kya tumne movie dekhi hai?
No I have not seen it yet, I want to though. I want to know if they stay together or they have a struggle with their relationship	Nhi maine abhi tak nhi dekhi, jabki main chahta tha. Main janna chahta tha ki wo saath mein rehne lgte hain ya wo relationship ke saath struggle hi krte reh jate hai.
Relationships are tough. I wonder how the two characters handle theirs.	Relationships mushkil hote hai. Mujhe suprising lgta hai ki kaise dono characters sambhaal lete hai.
Emma who plays Mia, writes her own one women play. That sound interesting! Ryan who is playing Sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together. I am thinking they sound like a fun couple.	Emma jo Mia ka role play kr rhi hai, usne one women play likha hai. Ye sunne mein interesting lagta hai! Ryan jo ki Sebastian is role play kr rha hai club pe or wo ikhathe rehne lagte hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki ye ek fun couple ki tarah lag rhe hai.
Do you know what the play is about?	Tumhe pta hai ki play kis baare mein hai.
No, sadly I do not know what it is about. I do know that Sebastian does not enjoy the music his band plays in 	Nhi, afsos mujhe nhi pta ki yeh kis baare mein hai. Mujhe yeh pta hai Sebastian apne band mein bajaye jane wale music ko pasand nhi krta.
Is there alot of dancing also?	Kya is mein bahut saari dancing bhi hai?
I am not sure on that, but I would think there is. Sounds like it is filled with music! I love a good musical	Pacci tarah se nahin, but I would think there is. Iski tarah ki sound is filled with music! I love a good musical
I do too, if it is done well.	I do too, agar it is done well.
Does Emma Stone sing as well?	Kya Emma Stone sing as well?
When their band has the first tour Mis and Sebastian get into an argument! He thinks she wants him to be unsuccessful	Jab unka band has the first tour Mis and Sebastian mey bahas ho gayee. Usko lagta hain she wants him to be unsuccessful.
That doesn't bode well for the relationship.	Yeh acche sanket nahin hai for the relationship.
I think she is just an aspiring actress, not a singer. He misses her first play where noone shows up, and she owes the theater money and moves to Nevada since she can not pay. Getting very interesting!	Mujhe lagta hai she is just an aspiring actress, not a singer. He misses her first play jahan koi nahin aaya, aur she owes the theater money and moves to Nevada kyonki she can not pay. Getting interesting!
Does he go with her to Nevada?	Kya woh uske saath go to Nevada?
No, she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play. Her first play sounds like it was a bust	Nahin, she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play. Her first play lagta hai was a bust.
It sounds like it. Writing plays must be difficult. Sounds like she took it hard.	Aissa lagta hai, writing plays must be difficult. Aur lagta hai she  took it hard
John Legend plays Keith, he is a band member. I bet hes a great bank member!	John Legend plays Keith woh band member hai. Shart laga sakta hoo hes a great bank member!
I bet you are right.	me bet laga sakta hu ke tum right ho
I am sure she just did not have enough experience for the play writing and how to execute the play and promote it. 	me sure hu ki use play writing aur ise execute karane  ka paryapt experience nahi tha ,aur na hi promote kare ka.
Well, this sounds like an interesting movie. Thanks for all the information.	well, ye ek interesting movie lagti he.All information ke liye thanks.
I do hope you will see it. I want to see how the realtionship plays out during the film. 	me hope karta hu ki app ise dehkoge.me dekhna chahta hu ki, during film , relationship kese play karati he.

I haven't but I've heard good things about it!	I haven't lekin maine achi baatein suni hai iske baare mein
What's it about?	kiske baare mein hai?
Well let see, It came out in 2010 and was produced by Dreamworks, it is a fully animated show.	well dekhte hai, ye 2010 mein nikli aur Dreamworks ki produced hain. ye bilkul animated show hai
Dreamworks huh? I do enjoy a lot of their movies. I assume from the title that it has something to do with dragons?	Dreamworks huh? main unke bahut movies enjoy karta hoon. I assume from the title ke iska dragons se kuch lena hai
It is set back in the Viking Days, and it has a teenage character named Hiccup, who finds a wounded dragon and befiends it.	ye  Viking Days mein set hai, aur isme ek teenage character  ka naam Hiccup hai,jisko zakhmi dragon milta hai aur dosti karta hai
befriends	hum dosthen hei
Oh the old boy and his dog story but with a dragon huh? That sounds pretty interesting. Was it received pretty well?	acha tho old boy aur uska dog ka story ya uska dragon ka? yeh tho badi interesting hein, kya yeh pretty hein kya?
The movie is a bit unique as it uses 3D animation , its a coming of age comedy, the same producers of Lilo and Stitch created it.	is movie tho 3D animation ka hein aur voh unique se hei. yeh age comedy ka aur same producers yaani Lilo aur stitch ka created hey
It seemed to do ok it got a 98% on rotten tomatoes, but an A in Cinema score	acha tho 98% Rotten tomatoes neh deya tha lekin yeh tho A nikla
I see! That sounds pretty good then.  You said it was animated but do you know who provides the voices?	acha! tho yeh kaafi acha rahega. aap animated bole lekin kon uska voice deya?
Actually some well known names come to mind, like hiccup is played by Jay Baruchel. And Gerard Butler as the chief Viking, America Ferrera plays a friend of Hiccup. Hiccup is the main character of course.	actually kuch jaan pehechan ka naam mera mind mei aa raha hei yaani hiccup ka role tho Jay baruchel ne kiya aur gerard butler ka role chief viking aur america ferrere ka role tho hiccup ka friend ne kiya actually Hiccup tho main character hein
That's really cool. I'm sure they do a great job. I really like animated movies so I might have to check that one out sometime.	oh tho acha rehega. muje animated movies dekhna pasand hein mein kuch movies aisa dekha hoon
I have actually seen it and I would recommend it	mein tho dekh chuka hoon aur mein is movie ko recommend karunga
You mentioned that he befriends a dragon. Can you tell me anything more about that?	jaise aap kahe vaise uska friend hi dragon hein, kya aur kuch uska baare mein aap batha sakthe ho?
Sure, the Dragons name is Night fury. And the movie doesn't have much of a storyline, but it has battles between tamed and evil ones.	jarur, Dragon ka naam hein Night fury, aur us movie mein kafi storyline nahi hein lakin uska tamed aur evil one ka battles chal raha hein.
Do youlike dragons?	kya tumhe dragons pasand hai?
I see, that sounds pretty interesting though. I do! Dragons are usually the bad guys in a film so it might be cool to get a film with a good one	I see, kaafi interesting sound karta hai. Mujhe pasand hai. Dragons usually bad guys rahte hai movies me to kisi film agar wo acche hai to kaafi cool baat hai
And vikings as well. It sounds like a very unique setting.	Aur vikings bhi hai. Kaafi unique setting hai
YES, The isle of Berk is their village, and they are afraid of the dragons because they steal their livestock, so when they come upon the dragons they usually kill them.	Haan, isle of Berk unka village hai aur wo dragons se darte hai kyuki wo unke livestock chura lete hai, to jab wo aate hai usually unko maar dete hai.
Oh no! But I guess Hiccup finds out that not all dragons are bad in the end?	Oh nahi! But I guess Hiccup ko pata chalega sab dragons bure nahi hote.
See Hiccup is scrawny and cant fight because he is scrawny, so he makes things, apparatuses if you will.	See Hiccup bahut scrawny hai aur isliye fight nahi kar sakta, to wo cheeze banata hai, apparatus bol sakte ho
but he isnt very good at it	but wo bahut accha nahi hai isme
I see, an awkward kid makes a friend of a dragon huh? That does sound very interesting.	I see , ek awkward kid dragon ko dost bana leta hai. sahi me interesting sound karta hai
I usually like animated films that have a good main character so this might be right up my alley.	Mujhe usually animated movies jisme accha main character ho pasand aati hai, to bilkul mere type ki movie hai
SO during one of those attacks Hiccup shoots at a dragon, and believes he has shot it down. Finds it later, not dead, but damaged. Helpes the dragon fly again then finds out that thedragonsare being Bullied by a bigger one.	To aise hi attacks k duaran Hiccup ek dragon ko shoot karta hai aur maanta hai k usne maar diya. Baad me pata chalta hai k maara nahi but damage kiya hai. Wo us dragon ko wapas udne me help karta hai aur pata lagata hai k sabhi dragons ko ek bada dragon bully kar raha hai.
I see! I bet he works together with his new dragon friend to help them out then.	I see! Mai sart lagata hu, ki  wo apne naye gragon mitra ko madad karne ke liye, milkar kam karenge.
So Hiccup and his friends decide they are going to help out Hiccups friendly Dragon and they all learn how to train awkward dragons and go off to fight the biggest Dragon which they call Red Death.	Isliye Hiccup aur uske friends ne decide kiya ki wo biggest Dragon ki jisko Red Death kaha jata hai unse ladai ke liye, wo Hiccups friendly Dragon ko madad karenge aur wo log sikhenge ki awkward dragons ko kaise train kiya jaye.
That does sound cool!	wo cool sunai padta hai!

I agree, it was a very safe bet for Pixar with how they presented it.	mein maantha hoon, safe hein pixar se bet karne, jo itna ache present jo kiya
Superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money, though.	Superstar actors jab voice acting karte hai to ye hamesha hi money making hota hai. though

I also like how they show the friendship between Mike and Sully develop	mujhe wo bhi bahut achcah laga jab wo Mike aur Sully ki friendship develop hote hue show karte hai.
Yeah I never thought of Sully as the cool guy iike that	yes maine kabhi Sully ko as the cool guy ke roop me nahi socha tha.

Who was your favorite character in the movie?	Movie me tumhara favorite character kaun tha?
I really liked Alex	Mujhe Alex bahut accha laga

Do you feel the movie had a fitting ending or was it a cliffhanger?	Tumhe kya lagta hai movie ki fitting ending thi ya cliffhanger thi.
As an historical drama there was little chance for a cliffhanger. So it ended well.	Kyuki wo historical drama hai usme thoda chance tha cliffhanger ka. To wo acchi end hui

I wonder why there is a gap in the Rotton Tomatoes score and the Metacritic score for Wonder Woman	I wonder Rotten Tomatoes score aur Metacritic score me Wonder Woman k liye itna gap kyu hai
hello! that is very strange, maybe they have different audiences, did you originally see this as a war movie? I guess i personally separate war movies from super hero movies	hello! ye kaafi strange hai, maybe unki different audience hai, kya tumne originally ise war movie type se dekha? I guess personally main war movies aur super hero movies ko seperate karta hu.
I do that too, I think of them both as different genres, even though Wonder Woman was set during World War 1.	main bhi wahi karta hu. Main dono ko alag genre maanta hu , bhale hi Wonder Woman World War 1 k duaran set thi.
Yeah I could see them grouping it together, I just usually separate them, I enjoy the actors though, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are great, how did you feel about their choices?	Haan, main unhen ek saath samoohabaddh karate hue dekh sakata tha, main aamataur par unhen alag karata hoon, main actors ka aanand leta hoon haalaanki, gal gadot aur chris pine mahaan hain, aapako unakee pasand ke baare mein kaisa laga?
I thought the casting was great, even though this was the first time I ever heard of Gal Gadot.	Mujhe laga ki kaasting bahut achchhee thee, haalaanki yah pahalee baar tha jab mainne gal gadot ke baare mein suna.
I was shocked though it was so well received with cirtics considering its a DC film haha, usually Marvel runs the place	Haalaanki main hairaan tha ki yah ek dc movie haaha ko dekhate hue sirtiks ke saath bahut achchhee tarah se praapt hua tha, aamataur par marvel jagah chalaata hai
I agree. I think one of the reasons it was well received was because Wonder Woman was trying to end the war, instead of contributing to a growing conflict.	Main sahamat hoon. mujhe lagata hai ki isaka ek kaaran yah tha ki ise achchhee tarah se praapt kiya gaya tha kyonki wonder woman badhate sangharsh mein yogadaan dene ke bajaay yuddh ko samaapt karane kee koshish kar rahee thee.
yeah, a lot of the marvel movies tend to just make up a conflict and then go with it instead of going off an existing one. I enjoyed it though, It is interesting the difference in opinions though, I don't know if I would see a second one 	Haan, bahut see marvel movies sirph ek sangharsh karane ke lie hotee hain aur phir ek maujooda band hone ke bajaay isake saath jaatee hain. mainne haalaanki isaka aanand liya, haalaanki yah raay mein antar dilachasp hai, mujhe nahin pata ki kya main ek doosare ko dekhoonga
I think if Patty Jenkins directs a sequel, it would be as good as the first one. She did a great job with this movie.	mujhe lagata hai ki agar patty jenkins ek seekval ka nirdeshan karatee hai, to yah pahale vaale kee tarah achchha hoga iss movie ke saath unhonne bahut achchha kaam kiya.
thats true, if they can keep the cast and crew together I think the chances of it being a hit increase. I believe thats more then 3 exchanges we've had about the movie now	Yah sach hai, agar ve kalaakaaron aur chaalak dal ko ek saath rakh sakate hain to mujhe lagata hai ki yah ek hit virddhi kee sambhaavana hai. mera maanana ​​hai ki 3 se adhik eksachenjon ke baad ab hamane movie ke baare mein socha hai
The document just updated for me. One of the things that caught my eye of the movie is how the time period was depicted, especially with how Princess Diana received a photographic plate whereas now we can take selfies. It is an interesting disconnect.	Dastaavez sirph mere lie apadet kiya gaya. movie kee meree nazar mein aane vaalee cheejon mein se ek yah hai ki samay avadhi ko kaise chitrit kiya gaya tha, khaasakar Princess Diana ko photographic plet kaise milee, jabaki ab ham selphee le sakate hain. yah ek dilachasp disconnect hai.
Oh mine just updated too, sorry about that. I think thats interesting and a good period for the film, I think the mythology involved behind it was very intriguing 	Oh mera bhee adyatan kiya gaya, is baare mein kshama karen. mujhe lagata hai ki movie kelie dilachasp aur ek achchhee avadhi hai, mujhe lagata hai ki isake peechhe shaamil pauraanik katha bahut pecheeda thee
I agree. Usually whenever Greek or Roman mythology is presented in a movie it is dense and opaque, but it was easily understood in Wonder Woman.	Main sahamat hoon. aamataur par jab bhee kisee philm mein greek ya roman pauraanik kathaon ko prastut kiya jaata hai to vah ghanee aur apaaradarshee hotee hai, lekin wonder woman mein yah aasaanee se samajh mein aa gaya.
Yeah introducing concepts like that can definitely be hard to follow sometimes depending on how they're presented. It's interesting that zues chose amazonian warriors to protect mankind	haan, is tarah kee avadhaaranaon ko pesh karana nishchit roop se kabhee-kabhee paalan karane ke lie kathin ho sakata hai ki ve kaise prastut karate hain. yah dilachasp hai ki zoo ne maanav jaati kee raksha ke lie amejan yoddhaon ko chuna
The way Ares was punished was also interesting, with only Zeus able to wound him in the battle.	jis tarah se eres ko dandit kiya gaya tha vah bhee dilachasp tha, keval zeus ne use ladaee mein ghaayal karane mein saksham kiya.
I liked that it was only them left, zues and ares had to fight to save mankind, it made it interesting with it being in a time period where the first time in history we had a world war	mujhe yah pasand aaya ki yah keval vaam, zeus aur eres ko maanav jaati ko bachaane ke lie ladana tha, isane ise us samay ke saath dilachasp bana diya jahaan itihaas mein pahalee baar hamane vishv yuddh kiya tha
I thought it was interesting that the American pilot crashed near south America, connecting World War 1 to the Amazonian setting was done very well in the film in my opinion.	mujhe laga ki yah dilachasp tha ki american chalak dakshin american ke paas durghatanaagrast ho gaya, pratham vishv yuddh ko amozon se jodakar meree raay mein philm mein bahut achchha kaam kiya gaya.
yeah it seems they did a very good job of having the plot points connect with real world situations, the island then being invaded by the germans looking to advance their warfare technology really gives you a sense of good side/bad side	haan, aisa lagata hai ki unhonne vaastavik duniya kee sthitiyon se jude kathaanak binduon ko jodane ka ek bahut achchha kaam kiya hai, is dveep par phir se jangalon dvaara aakraman kiya ja raha hai taaki unakee yuddh takaneek ko aage badhaaya ja sake aur aapako vaastav mein achchhe paksh / bure paksh ka ehasaas ho.
Especially with the Germans trying to engineer an even deadlier version of the chemical weapons they had, I think that ties very well into everyone's ingrained mortality. 	vishesh roop se germans ke paas raasaayanik hathiyaaron ke ek bhee ghaatak sanskaran ko injeeniyar karane kee koshish kar raha tha, mujhe lagata hai ki har kisee kee nirbaadh mrtyu dar mein bahut achchha sambandh ha
I also like that Hippolyta allowed her sister to train Diana, giving her the extra she needed to really stand out from the amazonian warriors 	mujhe yah bhee pasand hai ki hippolyta ne apanee bahan ko daayana ko prashikshit karane kee anumati dee thee, jisase use vah atirikt dene kee jaroorat thee jo vaastav mein amaajoniyan yoddhaon se baahar khade hone kee jaroorat thee
I felt that was a very feminist-inspired scene, which I really enjoyed seeing in the film. That was a big dynamic in how the World War was almost exclusively fought by men, with the sole woman wanting to end it.	mujhe laga ki yah ek bahut hee naareevaadee-prerit drshy tha, jise philm mein dekhakar mujhe bahut maja aaya. yah ek bada gatisheel tha ki kaise vishv yuddh lagabhag vishesh roop se purushon dvaara lada gaya tha, ekamaatr mahila jo ise samaapt karana chaahatee thee
that is a really interesting point that I haven't considered, I know that the film was widely proclaimed to give a voice to feminism but that point really solidifys that	yah vaastav mein ek dilachasp bindu hai jis par mainne vichaar nahin kiya hai, mujhe pata hai ki philm ko vyaapak roop se naareevaad ko ek aavaaj dene ke lie ghoshit kiya gaya tha lekin yah bindu vaastav mein thos hai
I really didnt except Sir Patrick to Ares, its an interesting dynamic that really came out. 	mujhe vaastav mein sar patrick se ares kee ummeed nahin thee, yah ek dilachasp gatisheel hai jo vaastav mein saamane aaya hai.
I thought the scene when Sir Patrick revealed himself as Ares also influenced that, where he wanted to use the Godkiller sword to destroy humanity, but Wonder Woman said no.	maine socha jis scene main Sir Patrick reveal kiya kyonki Ares ne bi influence kiya tha, jahan woh Godkiller sword ko use karke humanity ko destroy karna chatha tha, lekin Wonder woman ne no kah diya.
yeah I really didn't except wonder women to be the godkiller although it does make sense	yeah main really expect nahin kiya wonder woman hi godkiller thi although isme koi sense nahin hai
I think that was another big feminist point in the movie, in my opinion. The ending of the movie was very heartfelt and connected how wars of the past influence our present when Princess Diana emailed Bruce Wayne	i think woh ek bada feminist point hai movie hai, mere opinion hai.movie ka ending bahut heartfelt tha aur connect kiya ki kaise past wars hamare present ko influence karte hain princess diana ne email kiya bruce wayne ko
yeah, I think the dynamic between the all the characters fits really well, linking it all togheter, from diana and bruce, to diana and ares, and ares and zues	haan, mujhe lagta hai characters ki dynamics acchi fit karti hai, sabhi ko link karte hue, diana aur bruce se lekar, diana aur ares thak aur ares aur zues
The casting helped make the movie incredible, the charisma and chemistry between every character showed. The scene where Steve hijacked the bomber showed that very well I think.	casting ne help kia movie ko incredible banane ke liye, charisma aur chemistry ke andar character dikhta hai.jo scene jahan steve ne bomber ko hijack kiya acchi tarah dikhta hai.
Steve has a really inteseting role in the movie too, providing a lot of support but still not taking over the main role 	steve ka bhi accha interesting role hai movie mein, bahut support deta hai lekin phir bhi main role nahi leta
His character was an excellent supporting character in my opinion.	uska charcter excellent supporting charcter hai mere khayal se.

Yes, t hat and also about how Zeus met an Amazonian. 	Haan wo aur Zeus kaise ek Amazonian ko mila wo bhi
The training scenes were great with her mom the Queen though	Wo training scene uski mom the Queen k saath kaafi acche the
I mean her mom's sister, her auntie	I mean uski mom ki behen, uski auntie.
Oh for sure! I loved seeing the evolution of how she trained and how strong she got.	Oh bilkul sure! Mujhe uske training aur kitni strong hogayi ka evolution bahut pasand aaya.
I'm glad they made the lasso a strong weapon.	Main glad hu k unhone lasso ko ek strong weapon banaya hai
Yes. I also liked the scene when Diana saves Steve when he crashes into the ocean. A woman saving a man in a movie for once.	Haan. Mujhe Diana ka Steve ko uske ocean me  crash k baad bachane wala scene bhi kafi accha laga.Ek aurat aadmi ko bachate hue pahli baar
Yeah there was alot of feminine cheering  in the theater for that scene	Haan us scene me theatre me kaafi feminine cheering thi
I hated that her aunt died when the Germans invaded though.	Mujhe German invasion me uski aunt ka marna pasand nahi aaya.
yeah that was sad, pretty unavoidable though to advance the story and give gravitas to WW's journey	han ye sad tha, kafi unavoidable tha magar story ko advance karne ke liye aur WW ki journey ko gravitas dene ke liye
How did you like Sir Patrick?	Tumhe Sir Patrick kaisa laga?
I was a little surprised by his reveal, but I wasn't paying much attention to everyone else outside of WW, CP and the scenery tbh	main uske reveal se surprised tha, lekin main zyada attention pay nahi kar raha tha WW, CP aur scenere ke outside kisiko bhi
I saw that coming. Too predictable that he was Ares I thought.	Mujhe pata chal gaya tha. Ye bohat predicatable tha ki wo Ares tha I thought
right, but there's only so much they can do it's a huge movie designed for the masses, not for those with discriminating tastes ;)	right, lekin wo bhi kitna karein ye ek huge movie thi masses ke liye, discriminating tastes walo ke liye nahi
Haha, very true! I thought it was neat that they started the story by Diana reminiscing while looking at an old picture though!	haha, bohat sahi! mujhe laga ye kafi neat tha ki unhone movie ko start kia Diana ke ek old picture ko dekhkar huye reminisce karte huye
yeah the ending reminded me of Captn America with his story in the past and waking up to the modern day world	han movie ki ending se mujhe Captain America ki ending yaad agyi sath mein uski past ki story aur modern world mein jaagne ki
Yes, but from different universes ;)	han par alag universes se
Heh at this point it doesn't really matter unless you're really invested in either universe	Heh leki ye matter nahi karte is point par unless tum inme se kisi universe mein invested ho
True. Can't wait till the next installment! 	True. Main next istallment tak wait nahi kar sakta.
But with CP taking the bomber away to detonate is just like Captn America going to the Arctic to destroy HIS bom b	Lekin cp bambaare karane kelie visphot karane kelie door le ja raha hai jaise captain america apane bomb ko nasht karane kelie arctic ja raha hai
yeah, im sure it'll be a great one	Haan mujhe yakeen hai ki yah bahut achchaa hoga.
For sure, many similarities. I have to say I liked Wonder Woman more so than Batman VS Superman.	Mujhe yakeen hai ki kae samanataon kelie mujhe wonder woman ko batman vs superman se adhik pasand karana hoga
Hmmm wonder why this doc hasn't moved on. it's been awhile	Hmmmm aachar hai ki is doc par kyon nahin chale gae ise beete ek arsa ho gaya hai
hi	hi
hi	hi
so i heard you seen a movie?	to mene suna he you seen a film?
yes, Despicable me. It's an animated movie that came out a few yers ago	yes, me Despicable hu.ye ek animated movie he jo few year ago ayi thi
nice that's sound interested. can you tell me a little bit about it?	nice ye to interesting sound karta he.kya tum mujhe iske about little bit bata sakte ho?
would an adult also enjoy the movie?	kya ek adult bhi is movie ko enjoy karega?
Sure, it stars Steve Carrell as a supervillan, with Russell Brand as his scientist/partner in crime. It was directed by Pierre Coffin..	sure, isme Steve Carrell supervillan ,  Russell Brand jese star he , Russell Brand uski crime me scientist/partner he.
awesome	awesome he
do they offer a 3d version as well?	kya ve 3D version bhi offer karate he?
yes! It got a rotten tomato score of 81%, and most reviews praise how smart the humor is. It's good for the whole family.	yes! ise Rotten Tomatoes ke 81% mile, aur most revies ne prashansa ki kitna smart humor he.ye whole family ke dekhne layak he.
Yes, it comes in 3d and regular 	yes, ye 3D aur regular dono version me he
nice	nice
Do you want to know the plot?	Aap plot ke bareme janana chahenge?
i like steve carrell, he was funny in other movies i have seen him in as well. i think it would be funny to see him doing a animated voice over.	Mujhe steve carrell pasand hai, Maine uski jo bhi movie dekhi usme vo funny the. mujhe lagata hai ki use ek animated avaj par kam karte dekhana funny hoga.
no please tell me a little bit about it	Nahi, Mujhe uske bareme thoda aur bataiye
yes i mean lol	Haa, Mera matlab hai lol
it really is! It is designed very well, and his personality comes through in the animation. Steve Carrell is trying to steal the moon after another villan steals the Pyramid at Giza	ye vahi he! ye bahut hi achcha design huva hai, aur uska vyaktitva animation me aata hai. Jab Giza me dusre villan Pyramid churate hai tab Steve Carrell chand churane ki koshish karte hai
oh wow that sound interesting. what age group  would you see this movie is made for?	are wow, vo interesting sunai padta hai. Ye movie apko kis age group ke liye banai lagti hai?
I would say it's for young kids all the way up to adults. It is a good blend of silly and intelligent humor	Mujhe lagta hai, yah bachho aur sathme bado ke liye bhi hai. yah mukhatapurn aur buddhiman hasya ka ek achchha mishran hai
is there alot of singing in the movie? i dont particular like musical type movies but my kids do?	Kya movie me bahut sare gane hai? main vishesh rup se musical type movies pasand nahin karata, lekin mere bachche karate hain
there's a song written just for this movie by Pharell. It's not too much music, and it's probably too hard for kids to memorize & sing constantly, but there are characters called Minions that dance and act very silly	is movie ke lie Pharell ne sirf ek geet likha hai. Isme bahut jyada music nahin hai, aur shayad bachchon ko yaad rakhana aur lagatar gaana ga pana bahut mushkil hai, lekin isame Minions ka kirdar hain jo dance aur bahut murkhatapurn abhinay karata hai
oh ok. lol sounds like my kind of movie. I'm a big kid at heart	oh ok. Meri tarike ki movie lagati hai. main dil se bada bachcha hu
is the movie pretty long or standard?	kya movie kafi long hai ya standard?
me too, I really enjoyed it. It's a good mix of funny and feel-good, Gru eventually adopts three little girls who help him steal the moon. It is not too long, maybe 1.5 hours	mujhe bhi, maine isey bohat enjoy kiya. Ye funny aur feel-good ka accha mix hai, Gru eventually teen ladkion ko adopt kar leta hai jo usey moon chori karne mein help karti hai. ye zyada long nahi hai, shayad 1.5 hours
oh that is not bad at all. i think i will look forward to seeing this movie with my kids. should keep their attention for awhile. lol	oh ye buri nahi hai. mujhe lagta hai main apne kids ke saath ye movie dekhna chahunga. unka attention thode while ke liye bana rahega. lol
lol it definitely will! although they might just want to watch it over and over again	lol ye definitely karegi! although wo shayad isey bar bar dekhna chahenge
cool, this definitely helped me out . oh hey is this a disney movie or who is it made by?	cool, ye definitely mujhe help karta hai. oh kya ye disney movie hai ya ye kisne banayi hai?
It's made by a French studio Mac Guff, but Illumination Entertainment bought the studio and released this movie with Universal Pictures.	Ye ek French studio Mac Guff ne banayi hai, lekin Illumination Entertainment ne us studio ko kharid liya aur Universal Pictures ke saath us movie ko release kia.
oh wow i didn't know universal had their hands in animation. 	oh wow mujhe nahi pata tha universal had their hands in animation
i didn't either, I think maybe they're involved because it was a Computer Animated film	main bhi nahi. Mujhe lagta hain wo involved they kyunki ye Computer Animated film hai.
oh. makes sense	oh. makes sense
will you watch it with your children or let them watch it while you do other things?	kya tum isey apne bacchon ke saath dekhoge ya unhe dekhne doge jab tum kuch aur kar rahe hoge?
i thiink i would like to watch it with them. Sounds like it may be fun for the whole family.	I think unke saath ise dekhne me mujhe accha lagega. Aisa lagta hai ye puri family ke fun hoga.
Hello. Do you like movies?	HELLO, KYA AAP KO MOVIES PASAND HEIN?
Yes, but ones based on old toys are werid	HAAN, OLD TOYS KE BASED HO THO PASAND HEIN, THODA WERID HEIN
This one is called Real Steel and I trying to remember if I've watched it.	REAL STEEL THO YAAD HEIN, MEIN DEKHA HOON

I also think it's a little bit inspired by rock em sock em robots, an old toy	MEIN BHI SOCH RAHA HOON, KI YEH KUCH ROCK SE INSPIRED HEIN, JO SOCK JO ROBOTS AUR OLD TOY SE
Okay. I do remember watching it, because I saw that Hugh Jackman was in it. 	ACHA, MUJE BHI YAAD AAYA, KYON KI MEIN HUGH JACKMAN KO DEKHA US SAMAI
Sometimes I'll watch these if they keep my interest. I think I only watched it because of him.	SOMETIMES, MUJE INTEREST KE ANUSAR DEKHNA PASAND KARTHA.. MEIN THO UNKE LIYE HI WATCH KARTHA

Yea, I like thrillers or drama, who-dun-it kind of movies.	HAAN, MUJE THRILLER AUR DRAMA KO PASAND HEIN,
This is more of an action film with robots	YEH ROBOTS KA JYADA ACTION FILM MEIN SE YEK HEIN
Rotten tomatoes gives it 59 percent. I guess that means they say it's an ok kind of move. I remember the boxing robots though.	ROTTEN TOMATOES NEH THO 59% DIYA.. I GUESS KI YEH US KIND KA MOVIES KE LIYE THO OK HE HEY.. MUJE VOH BOXING ROBOTS KO YAAD HEIN
The deal where the winner gets the loser's robot seems a bit extreme	DEAL THA KI JO WIN KAREGA USSE US HAARA VALA ROBOT MILEGA, THODA EXTREME THA US DEAL
Lol. I see the movie was filmed totally in Michigan. Good for them. Tax credits. 	LOL, MEIN MICHIGAN KA MOVIE PURRA DEKHA, ACHA HEI, TAX CREDITS
Yeah, that was nice while it lasted. Seems to have dried up though	HAAN, VOH VAAKAHI MEIN ACHE HEIN.. LAGHTHA HEIN KI VOH DRIED UP KIYA HEIN
I live in Ohio and I hear about those "credits" for movies being made here. Normally I'd watch Hugh Jackman in other movies.	MEIN OHIO ME REHENE VALA HOON, AUR ME KAAFI US MOVIES KA CREDITS SUNA HOON... NORMALLY MEIN HUGH JACKMAN KA MOVIES DEKHNA PASAND KARTHA
He's a decent actor. 	VOH DECENT ACTOR HEIN
Didn't realize this movie was that old - 2011, time goes quick. I don't recognize the other actors.	MUJE YAKIN HI NAHI HOTA KI VOH 2011 KA HEIN, TIME THO QUICK JAATHA HEIN... MUJE DUSRE ACTORS KO RECOGNIZE NAHI HUVA
Neither do i	MUJE BHI
This reads like a standard boxing movie... but with robots	MEIN STANDARD BOXING MOVIES KE TARAH PADTHA THA, LEKIN ROBOTS KE SAATH

I'm reading through here looking for interesting facts about the movie. It says the film's based on a short story called "Steel" which was orginally published in 1956, later adapted into a Twilight Zone episode in 1963. Now that's interesting. The old Twilight Zone shows frightened me. lol	mein is movie ka interesting facts ko read karne ki koshis kar rahi thi.. isme likh hein ki, yeh film short story se based hein aur steel ka originally published kiya hein jo 1956 mein released, later twilight zone us episode ko 1963 ko adapt kiya, ab interesting hein, purana twilight zone tho kitna frightened hein. lol
I love old Twilight Zone but don't recall the one this is based on	muje old twilight zone hi pasand hein, ab recall mat karo
True. Weird, but even today some of the episodes spooked me.  It says the Metacritic Score 56/100. Who's Metacritic? 	true, weird tha lekin kuch episode tho muje spooked hein.. metacritic ka score tho 56/100, vaise metacritic kon hein?
I think they're another review aggregate site?	muje lagtha ki, vo another review site hoga
I watch the Twilight Zone mrathons on Syfy all the time	mein tho kahi baar twilight zone mrathons dekha hoon
If I watch them, it's only in daytime. I'm such a wimp. lol. I'm not familiar with director either - Shawn Levy	mein tho daytime mein hi dekhtha.. mein tho wimp hoon.lol.. muje us film ka director itna familiar nahi hein- shawn levy
Doesn't ring any bells for me either	muje bhi  koi bell mat ring karo
Genre is Science, Sports, yep that's true.	Genre tho science, sports hein

I can see some thing mixing. the human strugle 	main dekh sakta hoon kuch cheez mix hote hue. human strugle
now I rember it better where hugh jackman fights the bull in the beginning  	abhi mujhe achchi tarah se yaad aaya jahan hugh jackman bulls ke saath fight karta hai shuruaat mein.
the next to last bullet point is funny, "Though the premise of fighting robots does seem a plausible and intriguing extension of the contemporary WWE world. reminds of Robots VS wrestlers in How I Met Your Mother  episdoes 	last bullet se agla bahut funny hai, "maana ki fighting robots ki premise plausible lagti hai aur intriguing extension ek contemporary WWE world ki. yaad dila ta hai How I Met Your Mother waali Robots VS wrestlers ki

Hi! Today we'll be discussing Batman vs Superman!	Namaste! aaj ham batman vs superman kee charcha karenge!
Great! Do I need to watch any other DC Comic movies prior to watching this one?	Mahaan! kya mujhe ise dekhane se pahale kisee any dc comik movies dekhane kee jaroorat hai?
I can't honestly say, however, as a critic noted "it's better than Man of Steel but not as good as The Dark Knight". 	mai sach nhi keh skta halaki ye man of steel se better hai lekin dark knight jitni achi nhi hai
Who are the lead actors? 	lead actors kon hai>
It follows 2013's Man of Steel so you would probably need to see it just to be safe...	ye 2013 ki man of steel ko follow krti hai so safely dekhna
Batman, Superman and even wonder woman makes an appearance!	Batman, Superman aur wonder woman bhi hai isme
Haha! Do you know which actors play Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman in this movie? 	Haha kya aap jante ho ki is film mai konse actor Batman, Superman, aur Wonder Womanrole ker rhe hai?
Ben Affleck plays Batman/Bruce Wayne, Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent/Superman. Gal Gadot stars in the film as well as Diane Lane as Martha Kent and Amy Adams as Louis Lane. Are you a fan of any of those actors?	Ben Affleck Batmanka Bruce Wayne, Henry Cavill Clark Kent Superman ka role paly ker rhe hai. Gal Gadot film mai Diane Lane Martha Kent ka aur Amy Adams Louis Lane ka role play ker rhe hai. kya tum in actors ke fan ho
All but Ben Affleck. Lest super hero movie I saw him in was Daredevil and that was rough. Let's hope he's better in this. 	sabhi lekin Ben Affleck ki last super hero movie main usse Daredevils mai dekh tha wo mote tha hoskta hai isme kuch acha kam hoga
Though, I am a Michael Keaton fan when it comes to Batman. I suspect anyone playing Batman who is not Keaton will be weird to me. 	halaki me batman mai Michael Keaton ka fan hu muje lgta hai ki koi or batman ka paly nhi ker payge jo michel keaton ne kiya
Most of the critics wasn't too fond of it, but CinemaScore have it a rating of B, which I feel is about right for this film!	bhote se critics ko ye pasand nhi tha par cinemascore mai rating B thi muje lgta hai ye sahi thi
Have you seen it?	kya tumne dekhi hai
I have and would grade it a solid B, just as CinemaScore did. Are you a fan of director Zack Snyder?	Maine is solid B grade karta, jaise k CinemaScore ne kiya. Kya tum director Zack Snyder k fan ho?
I'm not sure. What other movies has he directed? 	Main sure nahi hu, usne aur kaunsi movies direct ki hai?
He directed Batman vs Superman. The film takes place 18 months after the battle between General Zod and Superman. Superman becomes a controversial figure while Clark Kent learns of Batman's form of justice and seeks to expose him via Daily Planet articles. 	Usne Batman V Superman direct ki hai. Wo movie General Zod aur Superman k battle k 18 month baad hoti hai. Superman ek controversial figure ban jata hai aur Clark Kent ko Batman k Justice k tareeke k baare me pata chalta hai aur wo use Daily Planet k articles me expose karna chahta hai
Has he directed anything else besides the Batman or Superman movies?	Kya usne Batman aur Superman movie k alawa kuch direct kiya hai?
I can't honestly say. I know he directed this film while David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio cowrote it. 	Honestly, main bol nahi sakta hai. Mujhe pata hai k usne ye film direct ki hai aur David S. Goyer aur Chris Terrio ne write ki hai
Batman and Superman are enemies in this film? 	Kya Batman aur Superman is film me enemies hai?
They are - Lex Luthor, who is obsessed with defeating Superman, basically manipulates them into fighting each other.	Wo hai. Lex Luthor jo Superman ko harane ko lekar obsessed hai , basically dono ko ek dusre ko fight karne me manipulate kar deta hai.
Whose side is Wonder Woman on?	Wonder Woman kis side pe rahti hai.
Well to be honest, Batman has Superman beat and just before he can kill Superman, Superman utters "save martha" to which Lane enterenters and explains Martha is his mother. Batman rescues Martha while Superman confronts Luther on the scout ship. At this point, Wonder Woman hasn't debuted yet 	Well to be honest, Batman Superman ko hara deta hai aur jaise hi wo Superman ko maarne wala rahta hai, Superman bolta hai "save martha" to Lane andar aati hai aur explain karti hai k Martha uski maa hai. Batman Martha ko rescue karta hai aur Superman scout ship pe Luthor ko confront karta hai. Is point pe Wonder Woman ab tak debut nahi ki hai
Dang! Crazy that Batman has Superman beat! Isn't Batman just a millionaire with a lot of fancy gadgets? Superman at least has real super powers. You would think that would give him a one-up. Did Batman have kryptonite  or something?	Dang! Crazy Batman superman ko hara deta hai. Kya wo bas ek millionaire nahi juske pas bhut fancy gadget hai. Superman k paas at least real super powers hai. Koi bhi sochega k wo superman jeetega. Kya Batman k paas kryptonite ya kuch tha?
I do very much agree with you! It is puzzling but Batman has a spear he plans to kill superman with just before he utters the "Save Martha" line, halting Batman from killing him.	main aapase bahut sahamat hoon! yah hairaan karane vaala hai, lekin baitamain ke paas ek bhaala hai, jisase vah suparamain ko maarane kee yojana banaata hai, isase pahale ki vah "sev maartha" lain ka upayog karata hai, baitamain ko maarane se rok deta hai.
Do the join forces after that?	kya usake baad sena mein shaamil hote hain?
they*	वे*
They do thankfully - Batman actually saves Martha while Superman travels to the scout ship to Confront Luther.	ve shukr manaate hain - baitamain vaastav mein maartha ko bachaata hai, jabaki suparamain ka saamana loothar ke saath skaut jahaaj tak jaata hai.
Does he kill Luther? 	kya vah ko Luther maarata hai?
Luther was also the one who kidnapped Martha. He doesn't kill Luther but Luther is arrested to which Batman confronts him while he's in prison, warning that he'll always be watching.	Luther bhee vahee tha jisane maartha ka apaharan kiya tha. vah loothar ko nahin maarata hai, lekin loothar ko giraphtaar kar liya jaata hai, jisamen baitamain ne jel mein rahane ke dauraan usaka saamana kiya, chetaavanee dee ki vah hamesha dekhata rahega
So basically leaving an opening for another movie in the franchise?	to mool roop se phrainchaizee mein ek aur philm ke lie ek opaning chhod raha hoon?
I've heard debates on Superman's and Batman's outfits in this movie. Some say that they are awesome and some say that they are ridiculous and too different form their b eloved originals. What are your thoughts on this?	mainne is philm mein suparamain aur baitamain ke aautaphit par bahas sunee hai. kuchh ka kahana hai ki ve kamaal ke hain aur kuchh kahate hain ki ve haasyaaspad hain aur bahut alag roop mein unake b ailovaid mool hain. is par aapake vichaar kya hain?
They do... Sadly, Superman dies, however, Bruce Wayne intends to form a team of Metahumans, starting with the Metahumans he found in Luthor's files to protect the world in Sueprmans absence. 	ve karate hain ... aphasos kee baat hai ki, suparamain kee mrtyu ho jaatee hai, haalaanki, broos ven ne metaahumans kee ek teem banaane ka iraada kiya, metahumans ke saath shuroo karate hue unhonne lyoopor kee phailon mein sooparamain kee anupasthiti mein duniya kee raksha karane ke lie paaya
While it did seem like 153 minutes of a grown man whacking two dolls together, I still found it better than Man of Steel.	jabaki yah aisa lagata tha jaise ek bade aadamee ka do minat mein ek saath do gudiyon ko pakadana, mujhe abhee bhee main oph steel se behatar laga.
Wait, Superman dies? How??	rukoo, superman maar gaya ? keise??
Well to be honest, at the end of the film, the dirt atop Sueprman's coffin does begin to levitate! I think we're at the finish line! I enjoyed chatting with you about Batman vs Superman! I highly recommend you seeing it one day. If you agree with CinemaScore, they rated it a B so I think you'll enjoy it and encourage you to watch it! Take care and have a great day!	bahut Imandaari se film ke aakhir mei  dirt superman kocoffin mei rakh deta hai ! socho ki ham aakhari line mei hai! hamare saath batman or superman ke bare mei baat karne ko maja le. mei aapko ek din isko dekhane ki salah deta hu.  yadi aap sahmat hai to filma ka score B hai mere khayal de aap pasand karoge  aap apna khayal rakhe or aapka din achcha ho!
Jaws is a very good movie even though it is older!	Agar old vi hai tab vi Jaws kaafi achi movie hai.
Jaws was made in 1975 and stars Roy Scheider.	Jaw 1975 ko banaya gya tha aur usme Roy Scheider actor tha.
how was the horror element?	Horror element kaisa tha?
It is scary but works because of the characters of the movie.	Ye scary thi lekin achi characters ke karn movie mein kam kar gyi.
that's cool	Ye to cool hai.
I did not know it was from a novel wrote in 1974.  Did you?	Mujhe nehi pata tha ki ye novel 1974 ko likhi gyi thi. Tumhe pata tha?
no I did not know that	Nehi main nehi janta tha.
It was written by Peter Benchley.	Ye Peter Benchley write ki thi.
how's the acting	Acting kaisa raha
I suppose the acting is good due to the direction of Steven Spielberg.	Mujhe lagta acting achi hai kyoki Steven Spielberg director hai.
does the shark do a lot of damage	shaark bahut adhik nukasaan karatee hai
It starts with the shark pulling a woman that is skinny dipping down in the ocean.	isakee shuruaat shaark dvaara samudr mein dubakee lagaane vaalee ek mahila ko kheenchane se hotee hai.
Her name is chrissie Watkins and her remains are found on shore the next day.	usaka naam kris votakins hai aur usake avashesh agale din kinaare par mile.
that sound scary	vah aavaaj daraavanee
what do they do about the shark	shaark ke baare mein ve kya karate hain
I know.  Of course then the police chief wants to close the beach for safety but the mayor says no due to the tourist season and summer economy.	mujhe pata hai. beshak, pulis pramukh suraksha ke lie samudr tat ko band karana chaahate hain, lekin paryatan seejan aur garmiyon kee arthavyavastha ke kaaran meyar nahin kahate hain.
What I can't believe is that because of the mayor the coroner changes his ruling from shark attack to boat attack.	mujhe vishvaas nahin hota ki mahaapaur kee vajah se koronar shaark ke hamale se lekar naav ke hamale tak ke apane phaisale ko badal deta hai.
wow what ashame	vaah kya sharm aatee hai
The place a bounty on the shark after he attacks another person.	vah shaark par ek inaam rakhata hai jab vah kisee any vyakti par hamala karata hai.
did someone take it	kya kisee ne liya
The local fisherman do catch a shark, a tiger shark. They assume that that's the killer shark.	sthaaneey machhuaare ek shaark, ek baagh shaark ko pakadate hain. ve maanate hain ki yah hatyaara shaark hai.
but i assume that the shark comes again	lekin mujhe lagata hai ki shaark phir se aata hai
Oh yeah, on the fourth of July it comes up and kills the police chief's son.	oh, haan, chauthee julaee ko yah aata hai aur pulis pramukh ke bete ko maar deta hai.
Did you know that jaws is actually supposed to be a great white shark?	kya aap jaanate hain ki jabade vaastav mein ek mahaan saphed shaark maana jaata hai?
that is intresting	yah dilachasp hai
were they able to stop the shark	kya ve shaark ko rokane mein saksham the
I think one of the best scenes is when the police chief, the shark expert, and the shark hunter all get together to on the shark hunter's boat, the Orca.  	mujhe lagata hai ki jab pulis pramukh, shaark visheshagy, aur shaark shikaaree sabhee ek saath shaark shikaaree naav, orka par pahunchate hain to sabase achchha drshy hota hai.
that sounds cool	yah sunane mein achchha laga
They finally do at the end.  They harpoon it while on the Orca but it get's away.	ve ant mein karate hain. ve orka par rahate hue ise pareshaan karate hain lekin yah door ho jaata hai.
It attacks the boat and eats the shark hunter.	yah naav par hamala karata hai aur shaark shikaaree ko kha jaata hai.
wow that must be scary	vaah jo daraavana hona chaahie
Then the police chief stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into it's mouth and shoots the tank.	phir pulis pramukh ek dabaavayukt skooba taink ko munh mein bharate hain aur taink ko golee maarate hain.
thanks i will watch this movie	dhanyavaad main yah philm dekhoonga
You really should.	aapako vaastav mein chaahie.
bye	alavida
bye	alavida

No one famous in it. Fionn Whoitehead. Never heard of him bbefore. Jack Lowden	Usme koi famous nahi hai. Fionn Whitehead. Uske baare me kabhi nahi suna. Jack Lowden
Great reviews from critics. But critics like artsy stuff. They were deeply moved. 	Critics ne badhiya review diya hai. But critics ko artsy stuff pasand ata hai. Kafi move hogaye the wo log.
Is it better than Saving Private Ryan?	Kya ye Saving Private Ryan se better hai?
I didn't like that one either. So even.	Mujhe wo pasand nahi aayi. To even hai.
How was the soundtrack?	Soundtrack kaisa tha?
I don't recall There was a lot of sound, but mostly of war. If you see it, go to a cinema with a great sound system. 	mei yaad nahi kar pa rahi hui vaha bahut jayada aawaj thi,par jayada yudha ki thi. yadi aap dekhana chahate ho to bahut achcha sound system ke sath jao.

The movie is called The Imitation Game, a drama that received a score of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.	movie ka naam The Imitation Game hai, ek drama jo Rotten Tomatoes main 91% score mila.
Nice, what is the movie about?	Badhiya, movie kis baare meinhai?
Have you heard of this movie?  It is about a cryptanalyst named Alan Turing who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during WW2.	Is movie ke baare suna tumne? Wo ek cryptanalyst Alan Turing naam ke vyakti ke bare mein hai jisne German intelligence codes ko decrypt kia British Government ke liye WW2 ke dauran.
I have not heard about it. If sounds like it would be a good movie. I already like the plot of the movie. Who plays in it? 	Uske baare mein nahi suna maine.Lagta hai accha movie hai.Already muje us movie ka plot accha laga.Kaun play kar raha hai usme?
This movie stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander and Tom Goodman-Hill as Sgt. Staehl - in all honesty I don't think I have heard of any of them haha.	Is movie mein Benedict Cumberbatch ne Alan Turing, Keira Knightley ne Joan Clarke, Matthew Goode ne Hugh Alexander aur  Tom Goodman-Hill  ne Sgt character nibhaya hai. Staehl - honestly maine in kisi ke bare mein nahi suna hai haha.
I have heard of Keira Knightley, I liked the Disney Pirate moves with Jack Sparrow. She played in all the movies. Good actress. I am surprised you have not heard of her. 	Maine Keira Knightley ke bare mein suna hai, Mujhe Disney Pirate ke moves Jack Sparrow ke ssath  ache lage. Woh sare movies me play ki. Acchi actress.

The Imitation Game received great reviews from critics and a CinemaScore of A+	The Imitation Game ko badhiya reviews mile critics se aur A+ CinemaScore se
I do not think I can either, I would need to google them just to see who they are and what they have been in the past. I hope they put together a good cast and crew for this movie. 	Mujhe nahi lagta mujhe Google krna padega ye dekhne ke liye ki wo kaise he aur wo vartaman kal me kaise the. Me asha karta hu ki wo achi film cast aur baki member ko movie me lenge.
that is nice, that gives me hope that it will be good. 	Ye acha he, ye mujhe asha deta he aur acha he.
The Imitation Game is directed by Morten Tyldum, are you familiar with any of his other movies?	The Imitation Game Morten Tyldum ne direct kiya he, kya aap inki bakio ki film se vanchit ho?

Very funny and inspiring movie!	arey mene dekha tha. Maaf kartna me galat samajha, mein koi doosri movie ke baare be soch raha tha.

It sounds like a good movie. It sounds like it is a good monsters inc successor.	Sunne mein lagta hai ki yeh ek achhi movie hai. Aisa lagt ahai ki yeh ek achhi monsters inc ki successor hai.
I agree. I'm slightly disappointed by the Rotten Tomatoes score. Then again, it is the first time that Pixar has made a prequel film. 	Main sehmat huin. Main zara Rotten Tomatoes ke score se disappointed huin. Phir se, yeh pehli baar hai ki Pixar ne ek prequel film bnayi hai.
Do you typically watch movies like Monster's University?	Kya aamtaur par Monster's University jaisi movies dekhte ho?
Typically no since i generally like to watch anime. But if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid. Then I usually will make a effort to see it.	Zyadatar nhi main aamtaur par anime movies dekhta huin. Lekin jab main bacha tha to ek hi franchise dwara banayi gayi movies dekhta tha. To main aamtaur par aisi movies dekhne ki koshish krta huin.
And i agree those scores kinda seem rather low.	Aur main maanata hoon ki voh score thode kam lag rahe hain.
I understand. Just by glancing at the ratings, do you think you'd make an effort to go see the prequel? Or would the score discourage you from seeing the film?	Main samjhta huin. Sirf ratings to dekh kar, tumhe lagta hai ki iss prequel ko dekhne ki koshish krte? Ya score tumhe movie dekhne ke liye discourage krte hai?
Id still see it despite bad reviews. I generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not. Like if 99% of people say its bad or good. I usually won't follow what i hear. I just go and experience it for myself. And then from there I usually say its cool or  say its bad.	Main isse bure reviews milne ke baad bhi dekhunga. Main zayadtar cheezein khud dekh kar decide krna pasand krta huin ki mujhe pasand hai ya nhi. Jaise agar 99% log kehte hai ki ye buri hai ya achhi. Main aamtaur par baatein sunn kar unke peeche nhi jata. Main bas chala jata huin or khud se experience krta huin. Aur phir main aamtaur par batata huin ke ye badiya hai ya buri.
Makes sense. I typically only pay attention to the ratings when it's a director who I am familiar with. If I know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings, I usually will wait to hear from friends/family before paying to see it. 	Samajh mein aata hai. Main jayadatar tab ratings pe dhayan deta huin jab main director ko janta huin. Agar mujhe pata hai ki aamtaur par unka kam bahut shaandaar hai or uss ek movie ke bahut buri ratings, main aamtaur par uspe paise lagane se pehle friends/ family se sunn leta huin.
Also im a fan of comedy movies. So I'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes.	Saath hi mein mujhe comedy movies bhi pasand hai. To main shayad memes or jokes enjoy karunga.
Ya same.	Main bhi.
Comedy movies are always a must see in my book. 	Comedy movies meri book me must see hain
And if im being honest, pixar usually makes good movies so I have good expectations. Illumination movies is what im " iffy" about.	Aur sach bolun to, pixar hamesha achi movies banati hai to mujhe achi expectations hain. Illumination movies keliye main thoda "iffy" hun.
I love that Monster's University has a fraternity involved. Even more so love it because they call it Roar Omega Roar.	mujhe acha laga ki Monster's University me fraternity involved thi. Aur bhi zyada kyunki wo isey Roar Omega Roar bulaate hain.
Mike is 7???? What in the...I never knew that.	Mike 7 hai???? Kya..mujhe ye bilkul nahi pata tha
ya that name is great.	han wo name bhadiya hai
He's only seven when he goes on the field trip. He goes to college eleven years later. So he'd be eighteen.	Wo sirf seven tha jab wo field trip pe jata hai. Wo gyarah saal bad college ko jata ha. To wo ab attharah ka hoga.
I misread that at first too. 	maine bhi ye pehle misread kiya
ahhh I see well that clears that up.	ahhh mujhe lagta hai ye sab clear kar deta hai
Looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities. 	lagta hai ye movie kafi heavily cartoon fraternities par based hai.
yep	yep
I find it odd that Pixar has a scene in this movie where Sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores. Doesn't really promote the whole 'fair play' imagine to their age demographic. 	muje thoda odd laga, is movie mein pixar ke liye yek scene hein, jaha sulley tampers with the machine ne better score kiya... aajkal ka demographic mein fairplay ne promote nahi kiya
Oozma Kappa. I can't believe they threw a kappa meme in there.	oozma kappa. muje nahi lagtha koi kappa ka meme banega
Every movie with a fraternity/sorority always contains 'Kappa.' Ever notice that?	har movie mein kappa ka fraternity/ sorority banaya. kya aap notice nahi kiya
ya. Its pretty much a dead meme.	haan.. pretty dead meme tha
Am i slow for thinking hardscrabble was male until this passage? lol	kya mein slow hoon, harscrabble yek male ko think karne mein
Wonder what CDA stands for in this movie. Clearly, it's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have? 	cda tho is movie ke liye stands kiye... clearly, kuch enforcer form kare aur monster ke paas kis taray ka enforcer hein
idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough.	yeh kuch scary ke tarh bhi ho sakthe
Nope! I thought the same. I think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph. 	nahi, muje bhi aise hi kuch lagtha,.. kyon ki is mein kuch gender context nahi hein
yeah probably.	haan
Well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids.	tho yeh kids ke liye tho safe movie hein
No, I don't think it's to make sure they're scary enough... the CDA has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university. 	nahi, muje nahi lagtha yeh itna bhi scary hoga... CDA ne cop ko form kiya aur usse campus se expulsion karne ke liye university aathe
Although i  expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there.	thoda hidden adult jokes hein us college aur fraternity ne tho yek ya do slip jarur liya hoga
Ah i see that would make sense.	ah, ab hui na baath
I agree. I was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesn't coincide  with a kids film and what you'd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monster's actions,. 	mein maantha hoon.. us cheating portion is movie mein jo skeptical hein, lekin kids film ke liye tho bilkul coincide nahi huva... is saal ke bachon ko kya sikhane chathe yeh tho pura negative reinforces hein us monsters ka action ka
True. Movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them.	sach.. in dinno mein movies tho itna formulaic tropes hein, jo kids ko nahi dekha sakthe
I hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable.	movies tho fresh aur unpredictable honna mera hope hein
Keep the kids on their toes.	kids ko tho hum hamare toes mein rakhna chahiye
One can only hope. 	har kisi ka hope hein
And still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it.	smart bhi rehena chahiye, jo parents bhi enjoy kar sakthe
A 79% on a kids movie doesn't seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes.	79% kids movie tho bad hi hota mera opinion se, keyscenes ko badne ke baath
Thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good. And still seem better than movies today.	ISLIYE PIXAR KA PURANE FILMS ACHA RAHATE, MERA KHAYAL SE.... AUR AAJ BHI IS MOVIES BETTER HEY
Thats true. I think overall it sounds like a good movie.	YEH THO SACH HEIN... OVERALL YEH KUCH ACHE MOVIE SOUNDS KARTHA
Hi, do you think this movie deserved a 92% Rotten Tomatoes score? That seems awfully high.	HI, KYA ROTTEN TOMATOES 92% DIYA JO DESERVED HEI? VOH THO AWFULLY HIGH HEI YAR
It's hard to say, They are usually my go to website for reviews but its rare you see a score in the 90% area.	USUALLY VOH REVIEWS KE LIYE WEBSITE JAATHE, LEKIN RARE SE UNKO 90% AREA KO DEKHNE PE LETHE
I have noticed that too! I love Octavia Spencer in anything she does. 	MEIN BHI YEH NOTICED KIYAHOON. MUJE OCTAVIA SPENCER PASAND HEIN
I don't know much of her work but I am a big fan of Guillermo Del Toro	MUJE UNKA WORK KE BAARE MEIN KUCH PATHA NAHI, LEKIN MEIN GUILLERMO DEL TORO KA BADI FAN HOON
and it seems the critics had alot to say on this film as well !	AUR CRITICS THO IS FILM KE LIYE KAAFI KUCH KEHANE KO HE
I'll have to check out his other films. I am impressed that a movie about a humanoid amphibian creature could be described as "elegant and mesmerizing".	MEIN DUSRE FILMS ME CHECK OUT KARUNGA.. MEIN IS MOVIE SE IMPRESSED HOON, US HUMANOID AMPHIBIAN CREATURE SE JO ELEGANT AUR MESMERIZING SE DESCRIBED KIYA HEIN
that is quite the compliment indeed,  I have yet to see the it but i definitely plan too. are you a fan of drama films?	VOH THODA COMPLIMENT HEIN, INDEED MUJE DEKHNA PASAND HEIN, MEIN JARUR PLAN KARUNGI, AAP DRAMA FILMS KA FAN HO?
I really love drama films, but I try to stay away from fantasy. I liked this one, though.	MUJE DRAMA FILMS PASAND HEIN, LEKIN MEIN FANTASY TRY KARUNGI. MUJE VOH PASAND HEIN
The acting by Michael Shannon and Octavia Spencer was impressive.	MICHAEL SHANNON AUR OCTAVIA SPENCER KA ACTING THO IMPRESSIVE HEIN
Hi, how are you?	hello, tum kaise ho?
Good how about you	Good, aur tum kaise ho
Have you ever seen jaws?	kya tumne kabhi Jaws dekhi he?

Yes. They kill the Shark and get to relax and be happy in the end	ha. ve shark ko kill karte he end me ,relax aur happy rahne ke liye
Aw man, spoilers haha	kya aadmi he, spoilers haha
Honestly I would recommend jaws. It's such a great classic movie	eemaanadaaree se main jabade kee siphaarish karoonga. yah itanee behatareen klaasik philm hai
Why not La La land? Do you not like it?	kyon nahin la la laind? kya aapako yah pasand nahin hai?
What genre is La La land? 	kya shailee la la bhoomi hai?
LA LA land is OK but it doesn't compare to the action of Jews. I give it a 7.8 whereas jaws is a 9.1	la la bhoomi theek hai, lekin yah yahoodiyon kee kaarravaee kee tulana nahin karata hai. main ise 7.8 deta hoon jabaki jabade 9.1 hai
LA LA land is a musical romantic Comedy	la la bhoomi ek sangeetamay romaantik komedee hai
Hmm, you might have to convince me a little more about Jaws just because I already know the ending. Since you said LA LA Land is a romantic comedy, is there any romance in Jaws?	hamm, tum mujhe jabade ke baare mein thoda aur samajhaane ke lie ho sakata hai kyonki main pahale se hee ant jaanata hoon. jab se aapane kaha tha ki la la laind ek romaantik komedee hai, kya joz mein koee romaans hai?
And is LA LA Land based on a real story?	aur kya la la laind ek vaastavik kahaanee par aadhaarit hai?
No. Jaws has little romance	nahin, jabade mein thoda romaans hai
Hi	hi
what is the name of the movie?	us mivie ka naam kya hai?
Bruce Almighty 	Bruce Almighty
what is the movie about	woh movie kis baare mein hai
The movie is about a tv reporter who complains about Gods presence in his life guidance and so is offered the chance to do his job for one week	woh movie ek tv reporter ke baare mein hai jo complain karte hai bhagwaan ki presence ki uske life guidance mein aur usko chance milta unka kaam karne ka ek hafte ke liye.

 It features an all star cast of Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Lisa Ann Walker and Phillip Baker Hall. 	usme saare star cast hai  Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Lisa Ann Walker aur Phillip Baker Hall.

I am not sure I at liberty to disclose that lol?	mein sure nahi ki muje liberty ka disclose karunga
re: the rules	yeh tho rules hein na
Ok	acha
but  I will tell you a little more about the movie	lakin mein is movie ke baare mein aur kuch batha saktha hoon
ok that would be great	acha tho yeh badiya hein
I keep meaning to watch it but seem to always forget	mein tho ab bhi is movie ko watch karna chuvunga lekin muje almost bhul gaya
So Carreys character, Bruce Nolan, is a reporter. Hardworking, but not very successful. He has a lot of bad luck and reaches his limit when his co worker receives a promotion over him	tho carreys ka character, bruce nolan hein jo reporter hein. hardworking lekin successful nahi hein. uska bad luck bahut hein tho voh limit mein nahi reach hota jab us coworker neih promotion ke liye gaya tho
He then starts his complaints to God who ends up responding with the proposition that gives him his powers	tho voh God ke paas chala jatha aur kaafi complaints kartha aur usko proposition ka power mil jaatha
So its like walk in someone else's shoes to see what they have to deal with.	tho yeh aise kuch hein ki dusron ka shoe mein ghuskar uska problem kya hein karke deal kartha.
More as in "why God leaves some prayers unanswered"	jyada hone se pata nai kyun bhagwan ne kuch prathnaon ko unsunna kar diya
oh ok	acha thik hai
Bruce starts responding with yeses to all the prayers he receives, and as you can imagine that's were a lot of the conflict AND comedy come in to play	bruce milli hui prathnaon ko haan main jawab dene lagga, aur jaisa tum soch sakte ho vahan par kaafi sangarsh aur comedy hui
I enjoy comedy that is funny but has a good story line.	muje vo comedy achi lagti hai jo funny bi ho aur achi kahani  sath ho
oh yea this one definetly has both and then the story to with Jennifer Annistons character as well	acha yeh ik pakke roop me donno aur phir Jennifer Annistons ke character ke sath hi kahani hai
Would you recommend this movie?	kya tum is movie ki sifarish karoge
oh yea 	are haan
From what you have said about Bruce Almighty it seems like a very good movie.	jo tumne kaha hai usse bruce almighty ek baht achi movie lagti hai
I actually forgot about it, and how well written it is now that I really think about it	muje yaad bhul gea, aur kitna acha likha k ab main iske bare sochne lagga
its a bit of a tear jerker too lol	yeh ik aanshu jatkane vala bi hai
I am looking forward to adding it to my list of movies to watch.	mai is movie ko apni dekhi jaane wali list me add karne ke baare soch raha hu.
I like feel good movies but do cry easy during movies that are tear jerkers.	mai feel good movies like karta hu but in rulane wali movies ke dauran aasani se rone lagta hu.
I would add this one, its worth watching	mai isse add karunga, yah dekhne layak lag rahi hai
I hope my movie store has it.	I hope mere movie store mai ye hogi.
also seems to be a bit of a classic especially with it being Jim Carrey	ye thodi si classic jaisi bhi lag rahi especially is Jim Carrey ke hone se.

I have netflix I will check there	Mere pass netflix hai mai waha check karta hu.

Hello, have you seen Monsters University? 	hello, kya aapne monsters university dekhi hai?
Hi	hi
This movie is about how Facebook got started by Mark Zuckerberg, it's called "The Social Network". Interesting to watch because it's based on real events.	Mark Zuckerburg ne Facebook kaise start kiya movie is baare me hai, iska naam hai "The Social Network". Dekhne me bahut interesting hai kyonki ye real events pe based hai.
I have heard of that movie before	maine is movie ke baare me pahle bhi suna hai
Although I haven't watched it before	Although maine pahle dekhi nahi hai
It was more popular than the book it was based on, The Accidental Billionaires, probably because it's a tale of Sex, Money, and Betrayal. Stuff we can all identify with	Yah jis kitab par yah aadharit hai usse bhi jyada popular hai, The Accidental Billionaires, probably because ye kahani hai Sex, Money aur dhokhe ki, wo stuff jiske sath ham sab identify karte hai.
Oh that is really interesting	oh yah to really interesting hai
It makes it sound more intriguing than before	yah to pahle se jyada intriguing sound kar raha hai
Have you seen it	kya aapne dekhi hai
Yes, we've all heard of Facebook, but the story of how it got started is pretty surprising. I didn't believe everything I saw in the movie, but it held my interest	yes, ham sabne Facebook ke bare me suna hai, but ye shuru kaise hua uski story kafi surprising hai. movie me jo dekha us sab par believe to nahi hua, par mera interest isme bana raha
I think sometimes they add information to movies just to keep the audience entertained	I think sometime ye movie me kuch information sirf ise interesting aur audience ko entertained rakhne ke liye karte hai.
Which is understandable because you don't want a boring movie 	Ye understandable hai because koi bhi boring movie nahi chahta.
I had no idea it was a book thogh	mujhe bilkul idea nahi tha ke wo book hai
No doubt, It is a drama. Zuckerberg and the current staff weren't involved in making the movie, it has a kind of dark irony, but one of the founders, Eduardo Saverin, was consulted by the book's author. 	beshak ye drama hai. Zuckerberg  aur current staff ka koi involvement nahi tha movie banane ,isme kuch dark irony hai lekin ek founder,Eduardo Saverin ne book ke author se mulaqat ki
I am sure there is information that they didn't want to leak in the movie and even the book	mujhe yaqeen hai kuch information  hai jo wo log movie ya book mein leak nahi karna chahte
So would you recommend seeing this movie? It a couple of years old if not older. 	toh kya aap ye movie dekhna recommend karte hai? ye kuch saal puraani hai agar aur zyada puranni nahi hai toh
Yes, it's an engaging look at that time period when websites were just getting started. Some of the lawsuits that came out of those beginnings might still be on going. 	haan, ye engaging look hai us waqt mein jub websites bus shuru ho rahe thay. kuch lawsuits  jo jub shuruat mein nikle thay shayad bhi bhi chal rahe hai
I believe it. I remember reading about the lawsuits when they were filed. I think they have great lawyers to protect themselves though...	mujhe yaqeen hai. mujhe yaad hai  maine padha tha jub lawsuits file hue thay. mere khayal se unke pass khud ko bachanay ache lawyers hai
The film starts in 2003 when Zuckerberg was a 19 year old student at Harvard. He actually created a campus website called Facemash that allowed users to rate the attractiveness of photos of female students.	film shuru hoti hai 2003 mein jub Zuckerberg  19 saal ka student  tha Harvard mein. usne asal Facemash naam ki campus website banayi jisme users female students ke photos ke attractiveness  ko rate kar sakte thay
That is a really good overall description for someone who wants a synapse  of the movie. 	ye puray taur par bahut acha description  hai unlog ke liye jinko movie ka synapse  chahiye
Oh, that's just the beginning. That website was so popular it got the attention of the Winklevoss twins, who were upper class men who made a dating website exclusive to Harvard.  So the origins of the idea for the site are kind of vague  	Oh,wo toh bus shuruat hai. wo website itni popular hai ke isko Winklevoss twins ka attention mila,jo  upper class men thay jinho ne Harvard ke liye exclusive  dating website banayi
Is the company protected by a patent or some kind of legal documents?	kya company kuch patent ya legal documents ki hifazat me hai
I don't know, but Zuckerberg was given 6 months academic probation for hacking into college databases and crashing the Harvard computer network. So he's aware of what kind of damage a rogue programmer can do.	Main nahi jaanta, par Zukerbreg ko college database ko hack karne aur harward computer network ko crash karne ke liye 6 months ka academic probation mila tha. So wo is baat se aware hoge ki rogue programmer kis prakar ka damage kar sakte hai.
As a programmer I could see the damage that can be done by hacking into databases and networks.	As a programmer me ye dekh sakta hun ki databases aur networks me hacking se jo nuksaan ho sakta hai.
damage was bound to happen in this situation	damage is situation me hone ke liye bounded tha.
So you also know that programming knowledge doesn't necessarily translate to business smarts. It's when Zuckerberg gets hooked up with Napster co-founder Sean Parker that the business really starts to take off	So tum bhi ye jaante ho ki business ko smart translate karne ke liye programming ka knowledge necessary nahi hai. Ye jab zukerberg ne Napster ke co-founder sean parker se hooked up kiya, is se business really me take off karna start karta hai.
I had totally forgotten about using Napster. I use to always use it. Had no idea he co-f ounded it.	Me Npaster ko use karne ke baare me totally bhool gaya tha. Me use hamesa use karne ka aadi hun. Mujhe koi idea nahi ki wo iska co-founder hai
There were other social networks before The Facebook, too, which is what Zuckerberg called it while expanding the site to Yale, Columbia, and Stanford. I liked Napster, too, and had a MySpace account.  But that all changed after Parker suggested they drop 'The' and move Facebook to Palo Alto. 	Facebook ke pehle bhi other social networks the, jo ki zuckerberg ne kaha tha jab wo site ko yale, columbia aur stanford me expand kar rahe the. Mujhe Nepster bhi pasand hai, aur mera Myspace ka account bhi hai. But ye sab badal gaya jab parker ne suggest kiya facebook to palo alto.
I I also had a MySpace account but haven't logged in roughly  2 years. 	Mere pass bhi Myspace account hai par maine kabhi hi 2 years me logged in kiya.
Been a while for me, too.  Parker ended up sharing a house in Palo Alto with Zuckerberg, leaving his partner Saverin in New York to work on "Business Development". Meanwhile they were developing plans for the business in California to make a billion dollar company. 	Mere liye thodi der ho gayi. Paker ne zuckerberg ke saath house sharing khatm kar di Palo alto me, apne partner saverin ko new york me hi business development ka kaam karne ke liye chhod diya. Meanwhile wo california me billion dollar ki company  ke business plan ko develop karne lage.
That is crazy. To have potentially in a company to make a billion dollar company is mind blowing	Ye crazy tha. Unke pass company ko million dollar ki company banane ka potential hai jo ki mind blowing hai.
Well, Saverin and the Winklevoss twins tried to keep their interests in the company. The film is intercut with scenes from their depositions in the cases against Zuckerberg. They eventually settled out of court because Zuckerberg's defense thinks he will appear unsympathetic to a jury.	Well, Saverin aur Winklevoss judwa ne apan interests company me rakhne ka try kiya. Film me un scenes ko intercut kar diya jisme Zuckerberg ke against deposition case the. Unhone eventually court ke bahar hi settle kar liya, zukerberg ke defense sochte hai ki wo jury ko unsympathetic appear hoge.
Well if he wasn't going to seem unsympathetic  than maybe it was the best choice for the defense 	tho, agar voh unsympathetic ke liye nahi jaayega tho defense he uska best choice rehega
No doubt, the film has lots of sordid details about the founding and the callous attitude Zuckerberg had towards his collaborators. But the end, when he's sending a friend request, is when it get's really weird. 	no doubt, film mein tho kahi sordid details hein us founding aur callous ka attitude ke baare mein, zuckerberg tho us collaborators ke sa saath hein.. lekin end mein, jab usne usko friend ko request diya tho thoda weird feel huva
Ugh I hate endings that either leave cliff hangers or just ends with no explanation of the future events	ugh, mein end hate kartha kyon ki voh cliff hangers ko nahi choda aur end mein kuch explanation bhi nahi diya us future events ko
I hear you. This ending has to deal with a world where Superman is absent, and after every one leaves, the dirt on top of Clark's coffin starts rising into the air. How about that!	mein sun liya.. ending tho world he deal karna chahiye, lekin superman absent they aur sabhi yek ke piche chod rahe the, clarks ka coffins upper se dirt ud raha tha hava mein. kaise huva yeh sab
Thanks!	thanks
Hello!	Hello?
Hello so the movie we will be talking about is Batman V. Superman	Hello to hum aaj jis movie k baare me baat karege wo hai Batman V Superman
Great! I haven't actually seen that yet, but have been really wanting to. Which actors play Batman and Superman?	Great, maine abhi tak wo dekhi nahi hai, but sahi me dekhna chahta hu. Batman aur Superman kaun actors bane hai?
The actors are really great and you probably know all of them. Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, and Jesse Eisenberg to name a few.	Actors sahi me acche hai aur tum probably sabhi ko jaante ho. Unme se kuch Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, and Jesse Eisenberg hai
Oh, that is a great cast? Henry Cavill played Superman in the latest Superman film right?	Oh, ye to badhiya cast hai? Henry Cavill ne latest Superman film me Superman play kiya tha na?
Sorry, a great cast!	Sorry badhiya cast hai!
I am not sure but the film is still a part of the DC extended universe. Also it will be featuring wonder woman.	Main sure to nahi but ye movie DC extended universe ka part hai. Also isme wonder woman bhi ayegi
Ooh, that is excellent. I am looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman! Are Batman and Superman enemies at the start of the film?	Oooh ye to excellent hai. Mujhe Wonder Woman dekhni hai. Kya film k start me Batman aur Superman dushman hai?
Well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with Superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman.	Well Lex Batman ko Superman se ladne me manipulate kar deta hai because wo superman ko clone kar ke liye obssessed hai.
Oh! So Batman is supposed to bring Superman to Lex Luthor?	Oh! To Batman Superman ko Lex Luthor k paas leke jata hai
No that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping. By the way did I mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together?	Nahi, waise nahi hota hai but wo use help karne me manipulate ho jata hai. By the way kya maine mention kiya ye pahli movie hai jisme batman aur superman saath me hai?
Really? The first time? That seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long! Very cool. Is the story set in Metropolis or Gotham?	Really? pahli baar? Ye jaante huye ke dono character itne time se hai ye cheez to bahut amazing hai. Bahut cool. Story Metropolis me set hai k gotham me?
The film appears to take place in both cities, and Batman comes to view Superman as a threat to humanity.	Aisa lagta hai k film dono cities me hoti hai, aur Batman ko lagta hai k Superman humanity k liye ek threat hai.
That is interesting, to have the film set in both cities. So Batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take Superman down?	yeh tho interesting hei yar, is film tho dono cities ke hein. tho batman ko aasan padega us superman ka duty karne mein?
Well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because Clark Kent A.K.A. Superman learns of Batman's justice methods and tries to expose him. All this happening while Lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator.	tho is characters ka relationships tho bada complex hein yar kyon ki clark kent ke vaje. superman tho batmans ka justice method learn kiya aur usse expose bhi kiya. tho lex luthor ne kryptonite ko approval kiya us senator se
Interesting. And so, I imagine Lois Lane is in this story? If so, does she serve a greater purpose? Does she know both superheroes?	interesting yar, mein ab is story ko imagine ki.. tho uska greater purpose kya hein? kya voh dono superheroes ko jaanthi hein?
Maybe but I am not sure. By the way do you usually care about reviews?	mein kuch sure nahi hoon. kya aap reviews ke anusar movie dekhne chalte?
I will often read reviews to see what people have to say, but I don't change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews. I think that I can't really know unless I see for myself. Do you care about reviews?	mein tho reviews ke anusar hi jaatha ki kaise logo is movie ko dekhthe lekin mein reviews se apna mind change nahi kartha. muje lagtha hein ki yeh sab bakvas hein. kya aap review ko care karte?
Not usually I like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not I watch in theatres. I have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed. 	nahi yar mein apne aap judge kartha.. lekin kuch reviews tho overwhelmingly acha ya bura hota jo muje theathres mein movie dekhte samai relate kartha hoon. muje lagtha hein ki is movies ka reviews thoda mixed hein
Did you enjoy this film?	kya aap is film ko enjoy kiya?
I did. I really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman.	haan yar.. muje vakahi mein is scene pasand hein .. batman tho superman ko kisi tarah manage kar raha tha
Cool. I guess that's one of the ultimate questions, which one could beat out the other. Do they team up at all in the film ?	cool.. tho konsa yeh beat karega? kya yeh film teamup hoga?
Yes in Batman chooses to save Supermans mother while Superman confonts Lex.	haan... isme tho batman ne superman ka mom ko bachana ke liye choose kiya lekin superman tho lex ko confonts
Oh wow! The pairing of Batman and Superman's mom is a really cool part of the story, heartwarming.	oh wow! Batman aur Superman ke mom ki pairing really sabse cool part tha story ka, heartwarming.
I know but the film ends with sadly the death of Superman.	I know but sadly fim ka end Superman ki death ke sath hota hai.
Oh wow! I am surprised by that, I thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two. 	oh wow! mujhe surprise hua isse, I thought wo log apni story line ko aage badhne denge aage ki ek do aur movie ke liye.
Dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the Director.	Don't worry coffin ke upar ki dhool ko hilte hue dikhaya director ne kisi badhiya wink ki tarah.
Haha! That's the closing shot?!	haha! wo to closing shot tha?!
I believe so it is in the last scene.	I believe so ye last scene me ha na
Awesome! Take care.	awesome! take care
Hello! Do you like superhero movies?	Hello! kya tumhe superhero movies pasand hai?
yes. batman begins! I think this a great batman film. have you seen it?	haan. Batman begins! Mujhe lagta hai wo ek badhiya batman film hai, kya tumne dekhi hai?
Yes, I have. Christian Bale is my favorite Batman so far.	Haan maine dekhi hai. Christian Bale mera ab tak ka favorite Batman hai
Do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them?	Kya tum usually movie dekhne se pahle uski ratings dekhte ho?
I usually do. but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not	Usually haan, but rating se ye determine nahi hota k main movie dekhunga ya nahi
The film has several great big name actors, which is another reason I like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone	Is film me bahut bade bade actors bhi hai, jo ki ek aur reason hai aur actors dekh ke hi movie dekh lege
I agree, there are quite a few great actors in Batman Begins. I like Liam Neeson too, even though he is one of the villains.	Main agree karta hu,  kuch bahut badhiya actors hai Batman Begins me. Mujhe Liam Neeson bhi pasand hai, bhale hi wo ek villain hai
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest. along with super heros and villans.  a good  rating does help me feel like I will not waste my time watching something awful	Badhiya actors ka saath me badi screen me hone ka potential me definitely mera interest. Superheros aur villains k sath hi. Ek good rating se mujhe ye feel karne me asani hoti hai k kuch bekaar dekh k apna time waste nahi karra hai.
but the same time will not deter me from a film If i am just into the genre	But at the same time wo mujhe movie dekhne se rok nahi sakta jiske genre me main bahut interested hu.
I personally prefer good ratings. Even if a movie has many good actors, if it's rated poorly, I usually won't watch it in theaters.	mein good ratings ko prefer karthi.. agar movies mein kitne bhi ache actors hote tho bhi rated poorly hi dethe jo mein kabhi theaters mein nahi watch kartha
I'm not sure if I agree with the Metacritic Score of 70/100, though.	mein itna sure nahi hein, metacritic score 70/100 diya
The 84% on Rotten Tomatoes seems more accurate.	rotten tomatoes ne 84% ne diya jo accurate hein
I will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on DVD/Video if the rating turn me off.	mein tho patience se wait kartha aur DVD/ video me hi dekhta..
What did you think of the bat scene in the movie?	tho aapko is movie mein bat scene ke baare mein kya sochthe?
I felt that scene shows the story of this film well, and is thought out.	muje laga, us scene is story ko showup kiya, jo thought out hein
I wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well, though.	muje lagtha hein ki bat keliya us dry well ke alava bhi aur kuch ache jhaga milega
batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out	batman, bachon ko ache film hein. kyon ki unhe life ka startup milega
Because this movie is called Batman Begins, I agree that it was appropriate to show Bruce's beginnings.	are is movie ko batman begins ka naam diya hein lekin muje lagtha isko bruce ka beginning dena chahiye
I think it's ironic that the mugger's name is Joe Chill, but he isn't  chill if he murders people.	haan joe chill ke liye tho yeh ironic hein, kitna chill se voh people ko murder kartha
unlikely yes, I think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be.  but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to   the bats	Shayad han, mujhe lagta hai ki wo log batman kaise bana uski mysterious shuruvat batane ja rahe the. par thodi mystery choodna chahta hu kyuki use abhi bhi bats se phobia ho jata hai
very ironic. mr chill is more of a bone  chilling murderer. 	bahut ironic hai. mr chill bone chilling murderer hai.
He is also murdered too, so at least he gets what he deserves.	Isne bhi khun kiya hai, so jo woh deserve karta hai usko mil gaya.
he got whats coming to him. but  bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge 	usko pata chal gaya tha uske sath kya hone wala hai. par Bruce uska khun nahi karega isiliye muje lagta hai ki usme revenge ki bhavna rahegi
I think it helps to establish that Bruce will not directly murder anyone. Even when he burns down the League of Shadows, he doesn't directly kill Ra's al Ghul.	Mujhe lagta hai ki Bruce kisika khun nahi karega aisa establish karna accha hoga. Woh jab League of Shadows ko jala deta hai tab bhi woh Ra's al Ghul ko directly nahi marega.
Injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder, in any case.	Kisi bhi case me khun ka karan anyay nahi bataya ja sakta.
I feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows, and to purge his fear of bats. this key part I think is pretty lucky break for him. as he is doing jail time in a foreign country.	woh lucky hai ki woh League of Shadows ka part bana hai aur usne apne bats ke dar ko bhaga diya hai. mujhe lagta hai ki yah important part uske liye lucky break sabit hoga. kyuki woh foreign country ke jail me hai.
It is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing...	yah bilkul ajeeb baat hai ki iski family naukar afford kar shakti hai fir bhi wah jail me chori karne jata hai
I really like Gary Oldman as Gordon. He plays a good cop really well.	Gordon ke kirdar me mujhe Gary Oldman bahut accha lagta hai. Wah achhe police wale ka kirdar acchi tarah nibhata hai.
What did you think of the Scarecrow scenes?	Scarecow scenes ke bare me aapke kya vichar hain?
The scarecrow was particularly scary character. trying to poison the water supply	Scarecrow tho badi scary character hein. voh tho water supply ko poison kar raha tha
and batman was poisoned with the fear-inducing drugs, I thought it was over for him.	aur batman bhi poisioned huva us fear inducing drugs se,  mein tho uska jaan khatre mein hein.
It appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points, yeah.	uska character tho over ho chuka tha kahi movie mein
I was surprised when the real Ra's al Ghul showed himself, too. The League of Shadows doesn't die easily.	muje tho surprised huva jab Ra's ka real face usne dekhayi tho, Voh League ka shadows bhi itna aasan nahi tha
He seems to have otherworldy power after surviving his past experiences	yeh tho otherworldy power ka surviving tho uska past experiences hein
Hello.	Hello.

I don't know, it feels like Bridge of Spies kind of vibe.	mujhe nahi maloom, mujhe lagta hai ki yeh Bridge of Spies ki trah hai
I mean I do like those types of movies but when it comes to Spielberg, you got to bring in the ADVENTURE.	mera matlab hai ki mujhe waise type ke movies pasand hai lekin jab Spielberg ki baat ati hai toh usme ADVENTURE hona chahiye.
Its supposed to be his trademark honestly.	ye unka trademark hai honestly.
Anyways yeah.	jaise bhi yeah.
This seem to be a very interesting movie to say the least.	lagta hai ye bahut interesting movie hai.
Haha I see he is a very versatile director though 	haha mujhe lagta hai ki voh ek bahut versatile director hai

The ratings for the movie seem appropriate for a Spielberg movie.	Spielberg movie ke liye yah rating appropriate lagta hai.
And how the soldiers were treated back home was terrible  	aur soldiers ko back home kaise terribly treat kiya gaya tha
 I can't quite remember how the media portrayed them 	mujhe utna yaad nahin haiki kis tarah media ne unhe portray kiya tha
They do 	usne kiya
Very terrible...	bahut terrible hai

So it was received pretty well.	To, kaafi well received movie hai
Is it something you could take a child to see?	Kya ye movie baccho ko dikha sakte hai?
I guess it depends on your style of parenting and how old they are. The movie does have sexual references and (I think) cursing. 	I guess wo tumhari parenting style pe depend karta hai aur ispe k wo kitne bade hai . Movie me sexual referencec aur mujhe lagta hai ki cursing bhi hai.
