hello	hello
hello there, I have not seen this movie so im going to take a minute to look it over :)	hello yar, mein is movie ko nahi dekha hoon tho, tho mein thode der ke liye isko dekh loonga
Alright that is fine. What is the movie?	acha tho is movie kis baare me hein?
The movie is The Social Network	is movie tho social network ke bare mein hein
I have not seen that one either.	mein aise kuch nahi dekha hoon
It appears to be like a biographical movie about Mark Zuckerberg and when he creates Facebook.	yeh tho biographical movie ke tarah hein, mark zukerberk ke baare mein hein kya jo facebook create kiya
Ohh yes I remember hearing about that movie, but it was a long time ago it feels like.	haan yar. mein bhi is movie ke baare mein suna hoon, kahi saal ke pehle aaya tha na.
Rotten Tomatoes has rated it 96% so that's decent, and it is a movie from 2010	Rotten Tomatoes ne toh 96% deya tha aur yeh movie tho 2010 ka hein
may be worth watching!	haan worth watching hein
Yes I think it could be, although I personally do not like facebook as a company.	haan muje bhi aise hi lagtha, lekin personally muje facebook itna bhi pasand nahi hein.
the movie portrays the founding of social networking website Facebook and the resulting lawsuits. It even has Justin Timberlake in it, I don't think I've ever seen him act. 	is movie tho social networking ke baare mein portrays kiya hein yaani facebook website ke tarah. voh tho Justin Timberlake hi hey, muje nahi lagtha ki voh aise act kar saktha hein.
I have not seen him in any movies in years	mein kaafi saalon se usse kuch movies mein nahi dekha
Any other big name actors in it?	aur koi badi actors hein kya is mein?
hmm so I just got a scene described to me, it turns out Mark was dumped so he made a blog about her ... kind of childish.... then he made a site for people to "rate" women on looks...the college put him on porbation. and then that captured the attention of two classmates , that how the trio came to work on facebook I guess.	hmm, tho is scene tho mark ke baare mein hein... thoda childish hein... voh yek women ke liye is site banaya tha... dono college mein the fir classmates ban gaye aur pyar karne lage, kaise koi facebook ke liye work kar sakthe
So it came out of Mark being kind of a douche, Makes sense when I think about the company 	tho mark jaise douche ko badiya film miltha. thoda uska company ke baare mein bhi agar voh soch lethe
Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer , and Max Minghella, not famailiar with any of those, id have to look on IMBD	jesse eisenberg, andrew garfield, armie hammer aur max minghella thoda familiar nahi hein..uska id bhi kuch IMBD
I am not familiar  with any of them either	muje bhi familiar nahi laghta
another scene came up, i guess this site was just for hrvard but then they expanded to Yale, Columbia, and Stanford... sounds very elite like lol	dusra scene mein, us hrvard ke baare mein hein jo yale, columbia aur stanford se expand huva.. kaafi elite sounds kartha.. lol
Seems like it was intended for the elite, but he saw the amount of money to be made by globalizing it	haan lagtha ki elite ne intended kiya hein, lekin kaafi money kharch kiya hein
and go figure Sean Parker who co founded Napster is in on it with Mark to make Facebook, i guess he is the one who persuaded him to drop the THE  as it was called Thefacebook originally	tho sean parker ne jo napster ke liye role play kiya tha voh tho apne aap ko persuaded kara aur Facebook ka originally role banaya hein
removing the word "the" was a smart choice atleast	the word ko remove karna waise smart choice thi atleast
yeah, flows a bit better I suppose so you can say "facebook me" lol	yes, ye thoda behatar lagta hai i suppose so tum kah sako "facebook me" lol
ah new scene, talking about all the lawsuits that came against him. 	are new scence, sabhi lawsuit jo uske against aate hai uski baat karte hai.
I feel like he has always been in trouble for the way he operates then	I feel wo jis tarah se operate karta hai wo hamesha hi trouble me raha hai then
Now it is the way he markets ads by listening through the phones	now ye uska tarika tha jisme wo market me add karta hai phone par sun kar
ending sounds weird, they said it ends with him sending a friend request to his ex who dumped him.  ironic.	ending thodi weird lagi, wo kahte hai ye khatm hua uske apni ex ko friend request bhejte hue jisne ise dump kiya tha.
Im sure that was just for the hollywood effect	mai sure hu ki ye just hollywood effect tha
yeah, he is a very selfish type of person I think in reality	yes, wo bahut selfish type ka aadmi, mere hisab se reality me bhi
I agree	I agree

Yep. The only thing I really didn't think would work is having Robert JR be part of a team. He seems to be more of a lone wolf type.	Haan. Ek hi baat mujhe lagta hai work nahin karti, woh hai Robert JR ka team mein hona. Woh loan wolf type zyada lagta hai.
He is the leader of the pack. I really dont think the averages would be as popular as it is if he wasn't the leader of the team 	Woh pack ka leader hai. Main nahin samjhta avengers itne popular hote agar woh leader nahin hota team ka.

Same here. I feel as they could've done without her. Do you think she should have her own movie?	yaha bhi wahi. I feel uske begair bhi ho sakta tha. kya aap ko lagta hai uski own movie honi chahiye ?
Maybe. It would help build her character up and she wouldn't seem as flat 	shayad. usko character build  karne madad milegi aur wo flat nahi lagegi
marvel movies dont flop but i feel as if her would flop. 	marvel movies flop nahi hote lekin mujhe lagta hai uske flop honge

I have.  It's very funny. Carrey is hilarious and I love Morgan Freeman.	Maine dekhi hai, Ye bahtu funny hai. Carrey bade hilarious hai aur I love Morgan Freeman
Yes, Jim Carrey was much more hilarious back in the days.  Morgan Freeman will always be the sound of "God" to me.	Yes, Jim Carry pehle ke dino me aur jyada hilarious the. Morgan Freeman hamesha God ki tarah sound karte hai.
Would you rewatch the movie?	Kya tum ye movie rewatch karoge?
Honestly.  I love Freeman's voice.  Jennifer Anniston was also very good.  But I did feel sorry for her character.	Honestly. Mujhe Freeman's ki voice pasand hai. Jennifer Anniston bhi bahut acchi thi. But mujhe unke character ke liye khed hai.
Yes, Bruce Almighty is one of my go-to movies.	Yes, Bruce almighty meri go-to movies me se ek hai.
The cinemascore for this movie is an A.  I'm not surprised at all to hear that.  All of the actors did a fabulous job.	Is moive ka cinemascore A hai. Mujhe se sun kar koi surprise nahi hua. Sabhi actors ne fabulous kaam kiya hai.
Yes I feel sorry for her character but her character sounds too much like her Friends days.	Yes mujhe unke character ke liye khed hai par unha character bahut kuch Freinds days ki tarah tha.
I do not think I would rewatch this movie.	Hume lagta nehi ke hum dobara ye movie dekhenge

Oh??  Why not?  Do you not like comedies?	Kiu nehi? Tum ko comedies achcha nehi lagta
Rotten Tomatoes has a rotten score for it, so I think i am swayed by that.	Rotten Tomatoes ke pas ek rotten score hai iske liye. Mujhe lagta hai ke hum usise behe haye hai.
Oh but the CinemaScore is an A.	Lekin iss cinema ka score A hai
Comedies seem to be very cliche and there does not seem to be one that I have favored in awhile.	Comedies kavi kavi bahot cliche hotehe lekin humko iye kavi passand nehi hai
Well I think the actors all did a fabulous job and the three main actors are all very good actors.	Mujhe lagta he ke sabhi actor achcha acting kiya hai lekin tin main actors bahot hi achcha kiya hai
Morgan Freeman is a good in all his roles	Morgan Freeman sob roles bahot hi achcha karta hai
However, I cannot say the same for Jim Carrey as he has had a downward spiral these years	Jim Carrey ke bareme hum ye abhi kehe nehi sakte kiu ke is sal pe wo achha nehi kiya
Totally totally agree!!  Morgan Freeman is the bomb.	Hum bhi tumse pura agree kartehe ke Morgan Freeman bomb hai

Me either. He did such a good job with avengers. If he had failed their is no way they would be releasing infinity wars in may 	Main bhee unhonne Avengers ke saath itana achchha kaam kiya. yadi vah viphal ho gaya tha, to koee raasta nahin hai ki ve maaya mein infinty wars jaaree karenge
Yep. The only thing I really didn't think would work is having Robert JR be part of a team. He seems to be more of a lone wolf type.	Haan keval ek cheej jo mainne nahin socha tha ki kaam karegee, Robert jr ek teem ka hissa hoga. vah ek akela bhediya prakaar adhik prateet hota hai.
He is the leader of the pack. I really dont think the averages would be as popular as it is if he wasn't the leader of the team 	Voh pack ka neta hai  mujhe nahin lagata ki Avengers utana lokapriy hoga jitana ki vah teem ka neta nahin tha
This is true too	Yah sach bhee hai
Who is your favorite member from the first avengers?	Pahale Avengers mein se aapaka pasandeeda sadasy kaun hai?

Black widow. Her character just didn't pop for some reason	Black widow. Usko character jyada pop ni kiya for some reason.
Same here. I feel as they could've done without her. Do you think she should have her own movie?	Same here. mujhe aisa laga jaise uske bina bhi they could've done it. Tumhe lagta usse khud ki movie milegi?
Maybe. It would help build her character up and she wouldn't seem as flat 	shayd. isse uska character build hoga or wo inta flat nhi lagegi.
marvel movies dont flop but i feel as if her would flop. 	marvel movies flop nhi hoti but i feel as uski movie flop hogi.

Yes, I agree that her character was very much a Friends style role. '	Yes, I agree  uska character bohot kuch friends style wala role tha
Oh??  Why not?  Do you not like comedies?	Oh?? Why not? Tumhe comedies pasand nahi?
Rotten Tomatoes has a rotten score for it, so I think i am swayed by that.	Rotten Tomatoes main uska rotten score hi tha, so I think i am swayed by that.
Oh but the CinemaScore is an A.	Oh lekin CinemaScore  A hai uska.
Comedies seem to be very cliche and there does not seem to be one that I have favored in awhile.	Comedies bahut cliche lagti hain aur aisi koi bhi nahi dikhti that I have favored in awhile.
Well I think the actors all did a fabulous job and the three main actors are all very good actors.	Well mujhe lagta hai saare actors ne fabulous kaam kiya and the three main actors are all very good actors.
Morgan Freeman is a good in all his roles	Morgan Freeman apne saare roles mein badhiya hai.
However, I cannot say the same for Jim Carrey as he has had a downward spiral these years	However, main Jim Carrey ke baare mein aisa nahi bol sakta kyunki he has had a downward spiral these years
Totally totally agree!!  Morgan Freeman is the bomb.	Totally agree!! Morgan Freeman to bomb hai.
And Jim Carrey has bombed in so many.  But he outdid himself in this movie.	arey jim carrey ne tho kahi bar bombed kiya.. lekin usse movie mein nahi nazar aaya/.
It seems like I will have to rewatch it in the end.  	muje lagtha hein ki muje end ko fir dekhna chahiye
I like how he uses his new powers to cause such miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events'	muje tho uska new powers ka usage bahut pasand aaya jaisa usne us miraculous events ko occur kiya
I don't like how he embarrases his other co worker but at the same time the character Evan was such an ass.	muje pasand nahi hein yar kaise voh embarrasses huva apne coworker ke saath.. aur evan ka character tho bakvas hein.
Lol, very true.  It sure makes the situation crazier that it should be 	lol, sach hein. isse aur crazier ban jaatha is situation ko
I probably would have done the same if I had been in Bruce's situation. LOL'	mein bhi aise hi kartha agar mein bruce ka situation hota lol
Likewise, I kind of wish I had his powers so I could do the same lol	agar muje powers miltha tho mein bhi aise hi kartha lol
And of course, God  (Morgan Freeman) steps in to save the day and tells Bruce what he should do.	aur us morgan freeman tho god bankar bruce ka day save kiya aur usse uska kaam nikal vaaya
Seriously!  Did you know it knocked off The Matrix Reloaded from the box office during its first week?	seriously! first week mein hi box office ko knocked off kara aur Matrix reloaded
Noooo I didn't know that.  I enjoyed the first Matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be the  hit the first one was.  Saying that I can see why it knocked it out of it's place.	nahi muje nahi patha.. lekin mein first matrix ko enjoy kar raha tha lekin donon aapas mein hit kar rahe thei.. dono us place ke liye knocked out kar rahe they
When it all comes down to it, this is one of my favorite movies.  I'm not a big movie fan but this is one I can rewatch many times.	jab sab kuch is par hi aa jata hai, yah meri favorite movie me se hai, mai big movies ka fan nahi hu but ye wali me kai baar dekh sakta hu.

yes I actually think this movie makes me want to see more true story type films	Yes mujhe Actually ye laga ki ye movie mujhe More true story type films dekhne ke liye make karegi
I would not be surprised at all if this was a hidden real story that the government did not want to get out  	Mujhe surprised nahi hoga ye jaankar ki Ye ek Hidden Real Story thi jo ki Government nahi chahti ki bahar aaye.
that's what it seems like that it was a 30 year old document that they didn't want people to know about	Aisa lagta hai ki ye ek  30 year old document hai Jise wo nahi chahte ki people iske baare me jaane

Hi! The movie I want to talk to you about today is Steven Spielberg's JAWS. It has a 97% review on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 8/10 IMDB rating!	namaste! aaj main jis philm ke baare mein aapase baat karana chaahata hoon vah hai steven spielberg kee jaws
Yes, that was worth a one time watch back in the 70's!	haan, yah 70 ke dashak mein ek baar dekhane laayak tha!
So do you agree with the ratings of the movie? Many people find it to be a scary thriller, but others describe it as being too gruesome. What do you think? Do you like this kind of movie?	to kya aap philm kee reting se sahamat hain? kaee logon ko yah ek daraavana thrilar lagata hai, lekin any log ise bheeshan bataate hain. tum kya sochate ho? kya aapako is tarah kee philm pasand hai?
I found it to be to gruesome and didn't agree with the rating.  But then, I don't like violent movies.	I found it to be to gruesome  aur reting se sahamat nahin tha. lekin phir, mujhe hinsak philmen pasand nahin hain.
I hear ya. But, maybe you should give it another try! It's a classic movie full of action and suspense. Steven Spielberg never disappoints. Do you typically like Steven Spielberg movies?	main aapakee baat sunata hoon.lekin, shaayad aapako ise ek aur koshish denee chaahie! yah ekshan aur saspens se bharapoor klaasik philm hai. steven spielberg kabhee niraash nahin karate.kya aap aamataur par steevan speelabarg philmen pasand karate hain?
I'm not sure as to whether I'd like to give it another try or not,  but then again I liked ET. 	mujhe yakeen nahin hai ki kya main ise ek aur koshish dena chaahoonga ya nahin, lekin phir mujhe eetee pasand aaya.
Well, like one person put it, it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way. Since it's a classic, it might not be exactly as you remember. Might be worth the watch even if just for the laughs!	khair, jaise ek vyakti ne ise rakha, yah ek tarah se vudee elan kee tarah mazedaar hai.choonki yah ek klaasik hai, yah theek vaisa nahin ho sakata jaisa aap yaad karate hain. bhale hee sirph hansee ke lie ghadee dekhane laayak ho!
Perhaps the humor is subtle.  I recall not really seeing to much humor in it though, 	shaayad haasy sookshm hai. mujhe yaad hai ki vaastav mein isamen jyaada haasy dekhane ko nahin mila
Well, I suppose the film works for both types of people. Some love it because of its action and because it's a scary thriller, while others find it to be more humorous and funny. 	khair, mujhe lagata hai ki philm donon tarah ke logon ke lie kaam karatee hai. kuchh ko isake ekshan se pyaar hai aur kyonki yah ek daraavana thrilar hai, jabaki any ise adhik vinodee aur majaakiya samajhate hain.
That's true, and it probably also has a lot to do with the types of humor people like, or don't care for. 	yah sach hai, aur shaayad yah bhee haasy ke prakaar ke logon ke saath bahut kuchh karana hai, ya paravaah nahin hai.
Yeah, that's true. But, of course, most watch it for the thrill. For example, there is a scene in the movie where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While she's in the water, she's suddenly pulled under! It's unexpected and thrilling, one of the reasons why I enjoy this movie. 	haan voh sach hein. par jyada log us thrill ke liye dekhenge. udharan, voh movie me yek scene yek aurat uska naam chrissie watkins skinny dipping karthi thi ocean mein. jab voh pani mein hein, achanak use upper pull kar the hein, voh toh unexpected aur thrill bhi hein, muje toh us movie dekhkar badi kushi huvi.
I honestly don't know what else to say...... This has been going on way too long and is honestly silly. I'm going to return the HIT. Hopefully you can abort the conversation and still get paid. This is terrible	muje kuch patha nahi ab vaakahi mein mein kya kahun... voh toh bahut long ja raha hein , aur voh silly bhi hein. mein toh return karne vala hoon us hit ko. isse aapka conversation abort hoga magar aapko paid bhi hoga. voh terrible hein yar
Ok, let's get this done.  Nice chatting with you either way!  :-)	acha ab mein chala. aapse chat karne se muje kushi hein

In the beginning, we find that Princess Elsa has magical powers. She accidentally hurts her sister with them, though.	Pehle hamein pata chalta hai ke Princess Elsa ke paas magical powers hain. Par apni sister ko accident se hurt kar deti hai woh.
Oh no, that is awful	Arey no, yeh to bahut bura hua
The king and queen take the younger sister to be healed, and the being that heals her also changes her memory so that she doesn't remember her older sister has magical abilities.	Raja aur Rani chhoti behen ko heal karane ley jaate hain, aur jo use heal karta hai wo uski memory bhi change kar deta hai taki wo apni sister ki magical abilities ke bare mein bhool jaye.
This is a good beginning	Beginning to acchi hai
Elsa eventually becomes queen, but she's terrified that people will find out about her powers and be afraid of her. They have a castle party, and the younger sister--Anna--falls in love with a visiting dignitary, who proposes to her. Elsa says, "No" and loses control of her powers in front of everyone.	Elsa aakhir queen ban hi jati hai, par wo darti hai ke agar logon ko uski powers ke baare mein pata lag gaya to wo usse darenge. Wo castle mein ek party dete hain, aur chhoti sister Anna ek guest ke saath pyar karne lagti hai, joki usko propose karta hai. Elsa use mana karti hai aur sab ke saamne uske powers lose ho jati hain.
Oh no D:	Are nahi Di
The Duke, the guy Anna fell for, brands her a monster. Elsa runs away, but the kingdom is left in an eternal winter, due to her magic.	Duke jisse Anna love karti hai, use monster kehta hai. Elsa door chali jati hai, par kingdom mein hamesha ke liye thand ho jati hai, uske magic ki wajah se.

Anna Elsa ko khojane jaati hai aur raaste mein kuchh nae friends se milati hai. jab ve Elsa,ko confront karate hain, to vah galatee se confront ko phir se injure kar detee hai.

One of her new friends takes her back to the same being who healed her before. He says that an act of true love is the only thing that can save her now. I won't spoil the ending.	usaka ek naya friend use vaapas usee ke paas le jaata hai jisane use pahale theek kiya tha. vah kahata hai ki true love ka ek act heen hai jo use bacha sakata hai. main ending ko kharaab nahin karoonga.

There is this great movie I want to tell you about called Toy Story	mei tumko Toy Story ke bare mei batati hui vo bahut great movie hai.
It was made in 1995 and was one of the first full length  computer animated films.	Ye 1995 Mei bani hai and full length computer animated film hai.
The voice actors in the movies are very famous stars such as Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and Don Rickles.	Is movie mei voice actor bhi Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Don Rickles ki tarah famous actor hai.
So have you seen Zootopia?	toh kya zootopia dekha kya?
Yes, I have. The movie was hilarious! Who was your favorite character?	haan yar, voh toh badi hilarious movie hein. aapka favorite character kon hein?
I'm not good with character names, but the fox played by jason bateman	muje character names kuch yaad nahi hein lakin fox ka role toh jason bateman ne kiya tha
Nick Wilde \	nick wilde
Who was yours?	aapka konsa
Oh okay, my favorite character was Judy Hopps. My favorite scene of the movie was when she got initially put as a parking duty cop.	acha, mera favorite character toh judy hoops hein. mera favorite scene is movie mein toh jab voh uska duty cop apni parking se shuru ki
I like the movie because it was something that both me and my children enjoyed.	muje is movie pasand hein kyon ki mein aur mera bachon bahut enjoy kiye hein
I actually watched it at a friends house because her 2 year old had it on repeat	mein toh apni doston ke saath dekha kyon ki uska 2 saal beta ko fir se dekhne ka man kiya
Oh, how funny. Do you think that the IMDB rating is appropriate?	acha kitna funny hein, kya aapko laga ki IMDB ka rating appropriate hota hein?
I do. 8/10 seems right. The Rotten Tomatoes review seems high, but it's impressive	haan yar, 8/10 toh right hi hota. Rotten Tomatoes ka review bhi high hota muje pasand hein
I agree, Rotten Tomatoes usually has horrible ratings so it is a bit surprising. I like the main theme that people can't be judged based on their color (well in this case species).	yeh sahi baat hai ki rotten tomatoes ki ratings kharab hoti hai usually, isiliye yeh todha surprising hai. Mujhe main theme acchi kagi jaha log judge nahi kiye ja rahe apne rang k liye. ( kam se kam is case species me)
What Holiday was this released around?	kis chutti k aap pass yeh release hui tha?
Do you think Judy recording Nick was an ethical decision?	kya tumhe lagta ki judy ne Nick ko jo record kia wo ethical tha?
I don't recall the holiday. I do think that it was ethical because he was a wanted suspect so she was just doing her job.	Mujhe holiday yaad nahi. Par mujhe yeh zarur lagta ki yeh ethical tha kyuki wo ek wanted suspect tha aur wo sirf apna kaam kar rahi thi
I think the ending made up for her recording, because she realized that Nick's past being bullied had a huge effect on him.	mujhe lagta hai jo ending thi usne sab sahi kar dia kyuki usko realize hua ki Nick ki past me jo bulling hui wo uspar kaafi effect ki hai
I also thought it was super unfair of Bogo to request her resignation so quickly. She was still new to the force.	mujhe yeh bhi laga ki yeh bohot unfair tha jo bogo ne usse resignation maanga kyu wo abhi nayi thi force me
I agree with that, it was unfair. However, she got tricked by Nick on her first day I honestly don't think she was qualified for the position.	mujhe bhi yeh baat sahi lagi, wo nayi thi.  halaki, wo pehle din hi Nick se trick ho gayi, wo is position k liye qualified hi nahi thi
She was a bit naive, but she also shouldn't have been out alone as a rookie.	wo todhi pagal thi, magar use akele aise rookie par nahi jana tha
I loved Bellwethers character, I know she's a bad guy, but Jenny Slate does such a good job	mujhe Bellwethers ka character sabse mast laga, mujhe pata hai wo buri thi usme magar Jenny Slate ne bohot accha kaam kia
I have to agree with you on that. I don't see her as much of a bad guy, since she offered Nick and Judy access to the security cameras.	Mai tumse sehmat hu ispar. Mujhe wo itni buri bhi nahi lagi kyuki usne Nick aur Judy ko security camera ka access dia.
In the end when Judy asked Nick to join the Zootopia police department, do you think that was a good call on her part?	end mein jab judy ne Nick se Zootopia police department ko join karne kaha tha, toh kya aap isse ache call kahe jaayenge?
Probably not, just because he ended up liking her doesn't mean he had completely turned himself around	bilkul nahi yar, kyon ki end mein usne pyar toh kiya lekin uska pura nahi usse diya
Yeah, the movie didn't show Nick developing enough for him to be trusted with that kind of authority. Plus I am guessing that his criminal background wouldn't go well.	haan, is movie mein toh nick neh uska trust aur authority nahi develop ki. aur muje guess hein ki voh criminal background mein jarur nahi aayega
It was sweet when Nick stuck up for Judy when BOGO tried to demand her to quit	voh toh pyara tha jab nick nei judy ke liye stuckup kiya jab BOGo nei use quit karne ka demand kiya
I agree, he definitely showed some development there, possibly just gratitude.	mein maantha hoon, voh toh kuch development showed kiya, kuch gratitude bhi
Did you think that the use of drugs in the movie was a bit too much? (the creation of drugs I should say)/	kya aap ko kuch aise nahi laga ki movies mein drug ka usage kuch jaasti tha?
I think it was innocent enough. Probably too complicated of a plot line to really do any harm to kids.	muje lagtha hein ki voh innocent tha. aur kuch plot line mein add kiye honge toh voh aur complicated ban saktha aur kids ke liye toh harm ho saktha tha
They could get the jist of it, that bellwether made the wolves do bad things, but beyond that, they probably didn't relate it to drugs as we think of them	jo kiya so paayega, jab wolves ne bad things kiya lekin voh drug se relate nahi kiya, jo hum soch rahe they
I know what you mean.	muje patha hein aap kya aap bole
My young cousin asked me what they were and why he was making them what they do to people, etc. So it might not influence most children but definitely some.	mera choti cousin pucha ki voh kya hein aur kyon us loog kon hein aur bla bla. isliye mein children ko nahi influence karne devunga.
